1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,420
Okay, let's talk about why we make bad decisions.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,550
So if you're like me, then you've probably been

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,450
in that situation where it's the end of the day

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,740
or it's the morning and you're thinking like,

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,700
okay, I'm gonna make a solid plan for myself.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,340
Today, I'm gonna be disciplined.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,400
I'm gonna come home from work

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
and I'm gonna get all these errands done

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,030
and I'm gonna treat myself really well.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,560
I'm gonna make a nice healthy, proper meal.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,260
I'm gonna go to the gym afterwards.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,410
I'm gonna exercise and then maybe when I come home,

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,020
I'll like start reading a book or something.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,520
I'll do something a little different,

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,900
something that makes me feel like I'm gonna advance my life

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,060
in a new positive direction.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,450
And this is our real life volition

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,880
and it's there to lead you on your way

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,460
to making good life decisions.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
But this doesn't always work out that way.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,210
Sometimes you get to the end of the day

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,820
and you realize that you haven't been very disciplined.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,220
At all, a lot of those errands are still

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,020
incomplete or like half-started.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,220
We didn't end up going to the gym

26
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,400
and instead of making a proper meal,

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,600
we've ordered some definitely not healthy takeout food.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,240
And instead of reading that book,

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,080
maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
and we've not advanced our life

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,120
in a positive meaningful direction in any way at all.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,980
What is happening here?

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,720
Why would we ignore the voice of volition

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,920
that's telling us to do all of these

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
beneficial positive things?

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,780
Well, it could be a lot of things honestly

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,760
and definitely having like a mental health diagnosis

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,040
is going to amplify this problem a lot more.

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,560
But even for the average person,

40
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,300
this happens like pretty often.

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,180
I mean, it certainly happens to me.

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,270
So what I wanted to share with you today

43
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,340
is a framework for understanding why this problem happens

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,980
and what we can actually do about it.

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,640
This is a real problem that actually comes up

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,780
in my work as a therapist kind of often.

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,220
And I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,600
so clearly and given such a unique role

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,400
within the structure of a game like Disco Elysium has.

50
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,300
So okay, there is a reason that we do not always follow

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,120
the voice of volition and go through

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,380
with our good intentions.

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,420
And it has to do with something called psychological friction.

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,280
So in this context, friction is any force

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,220
either internal or external,

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,900
which opposes a behavioral change.

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,690
So what do we know about like regular friction, right?

58
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,400
If I am standing on an ice rink

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,570
and I move my body weight around a little bit,

60
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,560
I'm gonna start sliding around on the ice.

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,560
There's not a lot of friction between me

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,040
and the surface that's under me.

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,300
When I step off the ice and now I'm standing on concrete,
