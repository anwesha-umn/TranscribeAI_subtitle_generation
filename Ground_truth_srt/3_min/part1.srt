1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,100
okay

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,000
hello

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,166
and welcome to the beginning of

4
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:08,000
a special playthrough of

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,466
a game that I have been

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,400
kind of like talking about with my community

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,933
to play for a very long time

8
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,466
it is Disco Elysium

9
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,133
if you are just discovering the channel

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,133
based on this which is a good likelihood that you are

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,866
my name is Brady

12
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:22,666
I'm a therapist

13
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,566
and we are gonna be doing like kind of a long form

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,066
analysis of the game that we're gonna play

15
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,733
we'll probably play out the games in the future as well

16
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,600
and we tend to ask a lot of

17
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,559
questions kind of in the space of

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,134
okay so

19
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:43,166
let's imagine this character was my client

20
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:43,966
like what sort of things

21
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,933
do I think that they would be dealing with

22
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,700
what sort of approach would I use to help them

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,933
so that's kind of what we're gonna be getting into and

24
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,733
I also myself am interested in creative writing

25
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:56,766
I would say like

26
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,133
I'm an aspiring writer

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,766
I have a bit of an imposture syndrome around like

28
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,166
I don't know if I'd call myself an author or not

29
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,533
I did write a science fiction novel a couple years ago

30
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,466
it's finished

31
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,000
I didn't publish it

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,566
and I don't know if I will at this point

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,733
it's just so old

34
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,766
now that it would need like a full rewrite and

35
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,200
I still keep telling myself

36
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,533
to go back and rewrite it or write something new

37
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,866
and I know that that kind of parallels Disco Elysium as like

38
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,100
this is not your average game writing like

39
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,200
there's a big focus on prose from what I can tell

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,600
I don't know anything about the story

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I actually don't even really know anything about the setting

42
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,100
the only things I really know about it is that it has

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,866
a lot of acclaim a lot of for its like creative

44
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:51,800
aspects for its like prosaic dialogue and narration

45
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,966
and that it's kind of a CRPG

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,166
I like CRPGs I'm a fan of Baldurs Gate and

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,133
Divinity series

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,800
I played original sin 2 a couple years ago

49
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,166
fantastic game

50
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm currently playing through Boulders Gate 3

51
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,933
really enjoyed pillars of eternity as well

52
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,366
so

53
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,933
those kinds of games I'm really into and

54
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,000
we have tried to play games on stream before but

55
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,466
just by the nature of like

56
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,900
discussing things from a therapeutic perspective

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,066
they can go quite long

58
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:28,800
so I'm gonna be trying to keep my thoughts a little more

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,166
focused and concise

60
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,133
but yeah I hope you enjoy what you see here today

61
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,400
we're gonna be uploading this

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
kind of periodically and if you want to come

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,466
check out the stream

64
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,300
see it live you're welcome to do so as well

65
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,666
so yeah let's do it

66
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,500
let's get into it

67
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,200
let's go I'm ready

68
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,066
oh there it is

69
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,566
got my little Brady box in the corner there

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,700
hey Brady I haven't seen you live in quite a while
