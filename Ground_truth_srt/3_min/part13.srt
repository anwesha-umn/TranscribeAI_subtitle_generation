00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,400
hello

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,366
and welcome to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:06,933
so on today's episode

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,743
the plot signed we are going to

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:15,546
see if we can establish our authority with Titus the union boss

6
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:19,133
we're gonna see if we can get a little closer to a confession from him on

7
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:23,533
who exactly was involved with the murder in Martinez

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,700
and over on the analysis side

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,140
we're gonna be taking a deep dive into the rigorous self critique thought

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,291
 now that we've finally internalized this one

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,500
it opens the door for a lot of discussion on

12
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,700
Harry's sense of self

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,716
and kind of digging into the question of

14
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,573
 is he actually a good person

15
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:43,790
 and if he's not

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,100
does  he think that it's possible to become one

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,200
this one's a little bit heavier on the analysis

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,250
这一点在分析中占比会更大

19
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:53,674
but it's pretty exciting to finally peel back more layers of our character

20
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,400
 so let's jump in

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,866
any predictions on where the story will go or who's the killer

22
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,500
I kind of had the idea

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,566
that we would be somewhat involved in the killing like

24
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,733
that we would be somewhat involved in the killing like

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,133
because we are so uninitiated to our own past

26
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,766
I don't think that we did it like would have hung him up like that

27
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,333
but I sort of have the suspicion that

28
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,866
the dock workers are kind of like a red herring

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,100
I just don't buy it

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,733
I just don't buy it

31
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,600
that's that's what we're leading

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,500
but I could be wrong

33
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:37,066
I am notoriously bad at predicting the plot

34
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,600
of anything ever like

35
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,933
when you have already probably noticed this

36
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:46,000
but like when politics or the plot are part of the dialogue

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,733
my brain like

38
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,566
it does this it feels like

39
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,027
it condenses down to like

40
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:54,100
I have to I've had to do this before

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
where I’m like  okay what is happening here

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,400
my brain is just equipped for like character or an analysis

43
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,764
and the way I engage with media just privately

44
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:04,133
 is like when I’m watching something

45
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,650
I’m not really thinking about the plot

46
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,400
I’m very rarely like what

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
I’m not like watching shutter island

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
and I’m like where is this going

49
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,166
I wonder what's gonna happen next

50
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,459
my brain just like accepts whatever's going to happen

51
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,766
but what I’m thinking about

52
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:18,102
is like wow what is that character feeling right now

53
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:19,430
you know

54
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,700
I wonder how like

55
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,579
whatever is going to happen to them

56
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,845
is going to change their worldview

57
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,733
like it's that's more where my mind is focused

58
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,787
and I kind of just accept the plot

59
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:33,366
 whatever it is it doesn't that matter that much to me

60
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,733
the sequence of things happening

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,300
unless it is so egregious that I’m like this doesn't make any sense

62
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:43,466
what if it was Lena well

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,628
I refuse to accept that

64
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:49,415
Lena is too kind hearted and good natured

65
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:50,966
 for her to be involved in that

66
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:53,500
（读chat）“有趣的是 心理治疗师们似乎很抗拒做这种事

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,708
it's funny therapists often seem to struggle with things like

68
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:55,733
it's funny therapists often seem to struggle with things like

69
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,000
predicting stuff or telling if someone is lying well
