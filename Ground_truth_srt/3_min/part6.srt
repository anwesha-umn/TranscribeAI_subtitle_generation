00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,485
hello

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:06,190
and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,400
so on today's episode

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,140
we're getting deeper into our different character studies

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,620
and kind of breaking down like the psychological dynamics

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,890
in their dialogue and their relationships

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,200
and everything that represents terms of mental health

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,220
this time I give a lot of focus to two characters in particular

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,400
that we meet on our journey through Revachol

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,552
and one of them that

11
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:29,551
I give kind of like my deepest

12
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,940
psychoanalytical impressions yet

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,660
maybe also my

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,360
most unhinged character analysis thus far as well

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,631
but it is in service of

16
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:46,480
actually kind of discussing like some important things about

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,437
how the game depicts its world building and

18
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:52,740
what characters do we need to look at

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,250
and in terms of like if we look at the shape of their mental health

20
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,300
this will tell us a lot about

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,807
what it is like to live in this environment

22
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:06,080
with these political systems with these social tensions

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,670
like what is the result of that on the people

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,380
who are actually being brought up in this world

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,100
so emm there's a lot to get into

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,020
I'm excited to share so

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
let's jump back in

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000
okay let's continue

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,898
so I think the last thing we were doing

30
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:27,733
is kind of investigating our relationship with kim here

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,280
I guess if it's a section of this that I missed

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,807
I guess if it's a section of this that I missed

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,860
ah "cool for" I see what you mean

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
I thought it was something I had to click on

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,050
so let's check out Inland Empire

36
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,880
because that's our main skill and

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,466
I'm finding it very interesting that this was the

38
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,600
primary skill that I chose

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,160
especially because in the last stream

40
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,540
I found myself kind of disagreeing with its intrusions a little more

41
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,800
it says it's cool for dreamers paranatural investigators and mental creators

42
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,680
I don't know if i'd call myself paranatural

43
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:11,038
but I am an investigator

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,878
and I am a mental creator meaning that

45
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,233
I tend to make stuff in my brain

46
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,560
that's better than I can make it in reality

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,180
empathy is cool for judges of character interviewers interrogators

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,140
that's me as well

49
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
volition is cool for sane people

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,580
well-adjusted cops

51
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,360
the non-suicidal

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,440
that's kind of half of us right

53
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,750
authority is cool for leaders

54
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,890
experts of psychologIical warfare

55
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,220
and respect junkies

56
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,240
yes yes and yes

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,532
this one is cool for cops

58
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,972
cop aficionados

59
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,140
and pretend cops

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,350
I feel like that last one is us the pretend cop
