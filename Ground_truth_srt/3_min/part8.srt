00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,500
hello

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,666
and welcome back to my

3
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:05,300
therapist plays Disco Elysium analysis series

4
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:08,066
okay I'm really excited about today's episode

5
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,500
we're finally getting into our first

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,100
encounter with the union boss Evrart Claire

7
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,600
and kind of breaking down lots of different

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
psychological angles on power dynamics and

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,300
have a lot to share today on real techniques that

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,933
I actually use in my practice as a therapist

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,866
to navigate sort of like difficult conversations with people who

12
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,600
either don't want to talk to you

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,700
or are in some sort of power struggle

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,500
and how do you sort of get that person opening up about things

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,000
we're gonna use some of these techniques on Mister Claire

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,933
and by the end of this episode

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,700
we're going to learn a little bit more about

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,900
ourselves and what kind of cop we are

19
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:53,100
yes we're finally getting our cop type

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,666
I'm sure very few of you will be surprised at what I end up with

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,400
so I'm excited to share this one

22
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:00,566
let's dive in

23
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,700
okay so

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,333
I have an objective

25
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,366
I have the objective to progress this game storyline like

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,800
I do want to

27
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:16,466
just like

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,933
mention why I am going about playing this game this way

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,600
because I do think it's relevant

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,800
when you see my character

31
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:29,800
do things like just totally give up on pursuing the narrative

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,966
to try to find like cigarettes for example

33
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,100
this is a role play right

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,400
so sometimes I'm gonna be speaking as like Brady the therapist

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,500
sometimes I'm gonna be speaking as like

36
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,466
Brady the degenerate who is using this as a kind of

37
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:48,900
escapism from my very serious real life

38
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,133
that I

39
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,900
like this is where I get to give be a goofball

40
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,166
and sometimes I'm gonna like

41
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,366
speak from the voice of my character right

42
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:57,866
and just like

43
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:01,366
say random nonsense garbage that I think he would

44
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,000
say or think right

45
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,666
and one of the things that

46
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,366
it is really important about

47
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,000
this character specifically because he is

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,400
someone representing the struggle of addiction is how like

49
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,133
we have all kinds of priority structures in our mind

50
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,133
right like

51
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,400
there's the whole just basic needs hierarchy of

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,666
like you need food you need water you need rest

53
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,500
and only once those things are satisfied

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,966
can you really focus on like higher order things like

55
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:40,600
you know your self esteem and your self worth and

56
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,133
the balance of health and your relationships

57
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,533
and those sorts of things right

58
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,733
the problem with addiction is that

59
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:51,866
your body has become dependent on on a chemical

60
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,133
one that is harmful to you

61
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:59,300
and so it completely hijacks what should be a normal
