00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:01,066
hello

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,100
and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,833
in my therapist plays disco elysium analysis serie

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,233
so this time I wanted to share something

5
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:12,266
that I learned about particular character in the game and

6
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:15,666
also some things that I learned about myself

7
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,133
in the course of uploading this series

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,900
so just for context if you're just come into this now

9
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,366
the way I'm kind of playing through the game

10
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:27,200
is from like the perspective of being a therapist

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,400
and trying to provide as much commentary as I can on

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,533
different angles of mental health that are depicted in the game

13
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,166
there's a lot more going on than just that at the disco elysium

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,833
but I'm really just I'm not the person

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,500
to comment on like complicated political stuff

16
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,966
and one of the most important dynamics in the game

17
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:49,200
is the one that you have with your partner Kim Kitsuragi

18
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,200
and I recognize that like as the player

19
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,900
we're going to be a lot more aware of

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,166
Kim's qualities than my character the detective well

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,900
and so in my role play of him

22
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:04,166
I've sort of been exploring the subject of

23
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,933
someone who is coming from a background of trauma

24
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,500
which we still don't know a lot

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,300
about Raphael from where I'm at in the game

26
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:21,300
but a lot of his issues with the way he views authority and relationships

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,000
and his struggles with substance abuse

28
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,033
kind of indicate that

29
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,066
there may be some of that background present

30
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,433
so I've been kind of approaching a lot of the dialogue

31
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,800
with Kim from this perspective

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,200
that like we tend to have an initial first impression about someone

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,100
that we may want to trust them

34
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,200
but if we're someone who has a lot of trust issues

35
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,500
we may sort of like test that relationship over time

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,333
we may kind of see where the real boundaries are

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,766
and from my character's perspective

38
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,666
he's kind of been trying to see like this

39
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,366
this Kim's sticking around with me

40
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:57,366
because he needs me to complete this case

41
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:01,133
or are the qualities that we immediately picked up on that

42
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,166
he is earnest and trustworthy

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,433
and a very honest character at hearts

44
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:09,900
are those things going to last

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,733
when we make ourselves very difficult to be around basically

46
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,933
I'm definitely going to ask him

47
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,566
I really want to impress him

48
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,033
and I want him to think that I'm cool

49
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,500
and that I'm not a fucking ass

50
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,833
I've been kind of trying to demonstrate that

51
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,633
like some of the closest relationships you can have

52
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:28,433
are ones that have really been put through that test

53
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:31,233
and have outlasted that period of

54
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:35,066
like if I push this person far enough

55
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,133
are they still gonna stick with me

56
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:41,533
a sigh the lieutenant buries his nose in his notebook

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,066
see there's another thing that that I'm not sure about Kim

58
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,000
the way that she spoke to me just now

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,800
she's giving an honest reflection

60
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:55,200
and she's empathizing with me

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,366
whereas Kim is showing me disappointment

62
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,700
and he's showing me mistrust
