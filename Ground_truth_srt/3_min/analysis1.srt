1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,133
okay

2
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:02,866
hello

3
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:04,241
and welcome to

4
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:08,166
kind of like a special little interlude episode that

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,700
I wanted to put out before

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,166
the next Disco Elysium stream goes live

7
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,400
so this is something I may do from time to time

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,533
kind of like taking

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,666
a chunk of the analysis and putting it in its own video

10
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,000
sometimes because it takes me a while

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,866
to sort of collect my thoughts on things

12
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:22,766
and it doesn't always happen

13
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,566
like while we're live on stream

14
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,066
but also because

15
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,600
I can kind of already foresee that this

16
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,800
playthrough of Disco Elysium is going to be

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,366
quite long going at our usual pace

18
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,000
and I know it can be pretty hard to get into

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,966
a let's play

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,066
when it's like episode 30

21
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:44,166
or something and so if you weren't really

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,766
there for the beginning of it

23
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,133
it's kinda hard to hop in

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,800
that far down the line so

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
I thought it would be cool to kind of like do

26
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
like little chunks of our

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,166
character studies and

28
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,640
like analysis of the games

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,133
 systems like how they represent different

30
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,533
parts of mental health like

31
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,166
just as their own separate videos

32
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,933
basically for the people who can't commit the time to watch

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
all of the let's play videos or

34
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,366
can't make it to the streams or that sort of thing

35
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,700
they can still enjoy

36
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:14,200
kind of the psychological breakdown parts of it so

37
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,366
that's what we're gonna be doing today

38
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,466
there's something that

39
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:19,000
I have to talk about basically like

40
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,100
I just couldn't really wait until

41
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,733
the next time I get on stream to talk about it

42
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,066
so that's what we're gonna do now

43
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:28,725
okay so there is something that Disco Elysium does

44
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:32,375
in its portrayal of a very specific aspect of mental health

45
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,366
 that I have never seen portrayed this way

46
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:36,500
anywhere else

47
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,933
so one of the biggest challenges when talking about

48
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,966
anything related to mental health

49
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,675
whether depression mental illness addiction

50
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:46,900
is it can sometimes be really hard to explain

51
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,000
how can you want something

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,650
you could desperately want to not be depressed

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,900
you can desperately want to be sober

54
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:01,400
and yet sometimes our behaviors really don't agree with that desire

55
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,600
and how you explain that to someone that

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,166
you sitting there wondering like

57
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,333
all I want in the world is to stop using

58
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,866
but I just can't

59
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,000
and this is kind of

60
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,466
you know a mentality that I imagine like our

61
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,866
lead detective

62
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,366
having been in at some point

63
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,133
before he lost his memory

64
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,666
and at least in my playthrough

65
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,733
it's something he's still struggling with right

66
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,866
as he does whatever he can find a pack of cigarettes

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,133
and for me it comes down to this

68
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,200
we tend to have a very limited

69
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,933
way of talking about the subject of motivation

70
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,800
like why you actually do things why you want things

71
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,266
and this is where Disco Elysium comes into the picture

72
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:42,166
with these different aspects of the main character psyche who

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,966
seem to have different

74
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,766
motivations for him

75
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,066
and they influence you as the player to sort of

76
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,700
follow different paths

77
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,666
one motivation in terms of the authority voice will tell you like

78
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,866
you need to smack that kid right
