00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:01,297
hello

2
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:02,451
 and welcome back to my

3
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:05,117
therapist plays Disco Elysium Analysis series

4
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:06,167
in today's episode

5
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,853
we are going to be taking a very thorough look at

6
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:12,572
how Disco Elysium portrays intrusive thinking

7
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:16,192
 when electrochemistry starts giving us thoughts

8
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:19,917
and they are very much opposed to the thoughts of volition

9
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:23,317
and how this actually very accurately represents

10
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:25,951
some of our very real thinking patterns

11
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:28,317
so we're gonna be using actual theory to break this down

12
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,484
using the cognitive model

13
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:33,351
how actual cognitive behavioral therapy works

14
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:36,246
and how we might apply it to a situation that

15
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:40,117
 our detective finds himself in with his own intrusive thinking

16
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,551
this one's gonna be quite in depth

17
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,617
so I'm excited to get into it

18
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:44,917
let's dive it

19
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:47,151
all right

20
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:51,151
so what we need to do now is figure out

21
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:54,884
where to go

22
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:03,017
this door he wants me to bust down

23
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:25,551
oh there's a end-of-day debrief

24
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,961
Kim can answer any lingering questions

25
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,471
you may have about the case and the RCM

26
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:32,451
 join him in the Whirling-in-Rags' balcony after 10

27
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,117
so what time is it

28
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:37,517
it's almost 10

29
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:42,117
so we've got a little bit of time before we can do that

30
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:54,884
do we have enough money to pay back Mr Garte

31
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:57,484
do we have enough

32
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,917
do we have it's got a ton of trash

33
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,484
let's go turn in the trash

34
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:07,117
let's pay a visit to the best character in this entire game

35
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:09,151
Frittte girl

36
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:12,017
let's see what she's up to

37
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,484
and let's get some money

38
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:25,851
yeah we're not accepting that bribe fuck that guy

39
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,686
I don't care I'll

40
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:31,658
we'll solve our many problems

41
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,417
 through rigorous environmentalism

42
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:52,528
I believe I'm supposed to talk to this gentleman first though

43
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:53,705
 see what he's got to say

44
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:55,851
 so how'd you like our harbor
