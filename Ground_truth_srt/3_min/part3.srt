1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,000
okay

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:04,700
hello and also welcome

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,266
it's great to be back on stream

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,666
and continuing our Disco Elysium play through

5
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:12,366
if you're just joining us

6
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,666
which is a good chance that you are

7
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,733
this is kind of still at the beginning of our little play through here

8
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,866
and what we're doing is we're kind of playing through it like

9
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,333
mix of role play mix of psychoanalysis

10
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm Brady I'm a therapist

11
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,300
and I'm going to be doing different kinds of

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,700
psychoanalysis on the characters

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,233
and kind of linking that to the game design

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,333
and like how it represents mental health

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,600
this game is just in another league

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,266
when it comes to that sort of thing so far like

17
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,400
I already did a video

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,166
kind of talking about the skill system and how it represents this like

19
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,766
very fascinating way to perceive like

20
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,466
motivation and psychological priority

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
so yeah we're like

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,066
we're gonna get pretty deep with this

23
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:01,500
the last two playthroughs or last two streams

24
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,100
I'm sort of just been figuring out the game and

25
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,866
now that I've like had some time to collect some thoughts on it

26
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,133
I'll be talking a little bit more about the

27
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:12,700
the characters and their dynamics and

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,025
like I guess why my character specifically is

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,100
showing a lot of avoidance and confrontation and like

30
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:27,400
is not maybe making some of the best decisions

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,666
I'm doing like a mix of my own headcanon role play like

32
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,566
I'm not trying to play the game the best way

33
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,200
honestly I'm just trying to make this fun

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,700
a fun play through like just kind of doing wild shit

35
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,600
we're not going to see every single part of the game

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,733
or every dialogue tree

37
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,966
and that's okay you know

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,800
but it has been great to get some recommendations

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,433
for things that like I just straight out missed

40
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,533
because of like

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,433
so far my character has just fallen into like

42
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,700
he's just failing upwards basically

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,000
like passing some of the early skill checks

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,500
some of the comments on the last video were telling me that like

45
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,566
missing or succeeding in some of these early skill checks has like

46
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,600
made me skip over a lot of tutorials

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,266
which makes sense

48
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:18,000
because I kind of feel lost on some of the systems

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,966
but that's okay

50
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,333
we're discovering it as we go

51
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:27,200
and I think that just makes for interesting play through dynamics

52
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,300
what I have been fascinated by is how well

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,200
the game has responded to my

54
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,333
weird way of approaching

55
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,600
it's completely fine that I skipped certain things

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,566
it's completely fine

57
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,733
that I don't know how to play it very well

58
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:42,333
it's not like

59
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,733
I've not reached a roadblock

60
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,000
where the game is like hey slow down friend

61
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,133
I need to teach you this before you move on

62
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,733
and it's happy to just let me move on and

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,166
try to fail my way through everything which

64
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,300
is kind of life

65
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,775
isn't it
