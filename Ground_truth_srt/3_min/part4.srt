00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,800
my name is Brady I'm a therapist

7
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:15,100
and we are doing like kind of a long form

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,500
psychoanalysis of the main character

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,966
and his companions and all the people

10
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,566
that we meet on our journey through Revachol

11
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,666
so in today's episode

12
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,366
we're going to talk a lot about

13
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:30,666
like our main characters reflections on his own self identity

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,266
as we sort of start to unpack and discover

15
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,666
things that he is remembering about his past and

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,066
psychologically what does it mean to

17
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,966
integrate a past version of yourself who you may not

18
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:45,733
have a lot of positive feelings about

19
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,566
into the identity that you're building today

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,166
and also we're gonna see if we could take

21
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,500
another shot this whole thing with Cuno

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,066
so

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
let's dive in

24
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,166
now one thing that is a kind of a hanging thread is

25
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,866
I want to return to my bedroom while I'm here

26
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,133
we're playing the game like reading some

27
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,700
psychological class material

28
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,766
yeah if you're new to the eurobrady experience

29
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,763
this is one part entertainment

30
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:14,800
 one part Masters level psychology lecture

31
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,533
one part my own

32
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,266
self therapy life

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,400
for your enjoyment

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,100
read the problem part let's do that

35
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,600
let's rewind let's trace your drunken steps back home

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,766
jump across the raised channel bridge southwest of here

37
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,366
fall over get up

38
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,666
get off the asphalt in 20 minutes

39
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,533
shuffle your feet through courtyards

40
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,966
scaring little children

41
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:40,966
that checks out

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,166
go under the great raised motor tract the 8/81

43
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,600
until you reach Le Domaine Aminol in north Jamrock

44
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,466
the streets are frozen this time of year caked with ice

45
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,300
walk down Main to Perdition

46
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,366
there's a side alley there

47
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,133
and your footprints in the mud

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
okay

49
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,866
there's something there

50
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,333
there is a past for me

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
okay

52
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,700
this

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,533
Kim also tries not to look at the pile of tape viscera on the carpet

54
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,166
or the weird suitcase on the hat rack

55
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,066
or the pottic plant dying in the corner

56
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,866
but it's all just too morbid to ignore

57
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:36,733
oh that's true

58
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:39,133
this is the first time I've brought Kim into the environment

59
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:44,000
maybe in a subconscious way I'm trying to understand again

60
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:51,166
how much can I destroy my own image to him

61
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,666
before I come to the conclusion that he's not going to abandon me

62
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,966
maybe if I show him
