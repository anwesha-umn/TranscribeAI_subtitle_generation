00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:00,933
hello

2
00:00:01,384 --> 00:00:04,866
and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:05,733
on today's episode

4
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:10,333
we're going to address something kind of unavoidable in a game like this

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,533
which is what are some of the crossovers between politics and mental health

6
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:21,266
and kind of some personal struggles I have about integrating those two subjects

7
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:25,500
i'm sure there will be a lot of discussion about this in the comments

8
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,866
just note that this is all recorded previously

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,033
I think I'm gonna probably make a dedicated video

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,778
it's some point kind of like compiling my thoughts a little more

11
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:41,633
but yeah we get an early look at kind of where my mind is coming from on this

12
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:42,500
aside from that

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,733
we have a very special moment in this episode

14
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:50,866
which is finally we're going to reach the end of our first day as a detective

15
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:51,833
it's taken us a while

16
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,128
and we're going to take another look at how

17
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:56,500
 Kim and I's relationship has been developing

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,866
over this very challenging day

19
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:03,200
and see if there's actually some things we've become quite close on

20
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,466
so all that's coming up I'm excited to get into it

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,800
let's do it

22
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,733
all right we

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
are gonna talk to Kim

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,966
we should think about calling it a day maybe

25
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,733
the nights are still miserably cold this time of year

26
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,400
I haven't paid the cafeteria manager for the damages yet

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,466
you should take care of that then

28
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:25,833
but I don't have the money

29
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,100
(let's) talk to him anyway

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,833
an officer of the RCM shouldn't be sleeping in the street

31
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,733
we'll figure something out

32
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,500
though he finds this situation frustrating

33
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:39,266
he is doing his best to not make you feel any worse than you already do

34
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,300
I respect that Kim

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,527
yeah his Kim has won a lot of points with me this

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,566
these chapters of our stream

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,933
okay let's see if we can reason with this gentleman

38
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,366
can I help you

39
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,433
but I don't have another option here

40
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,300
yes have you got it

41
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,466
can we come to some sort of arrangement

42
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,700
that arrangement include you pay me

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,766
what we already agreed

44
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:15,800
you owe me

45
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,300
Kim is about to say something

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,866
let him lets do that

47
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:25,066
I understand your predicament as the manager however

48
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:27,700
I feel I must remind you

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,066
that we are here to conduct an important investigation

50
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,400
that also affects your business

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,866
that's a good point put the squeeze on

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,566
forgive me for saying this

53
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:42,066
but your colleague seems more committed to drinking and

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,233
establishment sentence

55
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,500
he shrinks back a bit under the lieutenant severe gaze

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,233
I mean no offense it's really nothing personal

57
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:57,066
I just have to protect the interests of this establishment

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,900
kitty
