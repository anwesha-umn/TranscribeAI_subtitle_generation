00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:01,491
hello

2
00:00:01,558 --> 00:00:05,691
and welcome to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:08,291
so on today's episode I'm very excited

4
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:11,644
because we are finally getting to use one of my absolute

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,225
 favorite frameworks for analyzing characters

6
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,591
this is something that I use in therapy from time to time

7
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:24,391
and it's an incredible way to explore patterns of psychology and patterns of behavior

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:29,025
and sort of really uncover what is driving a lot of the complexes

9
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:34,583
that we see play out in Harry's thoughts and his actions

10
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,558
 and the reason we are doing that now is

11
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,049
because we are starting to learn more about ourselves and our past

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,991
 and take another look at that Ledger

13
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,486
and see what do we actually think about the person that we used to be

14
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:49,663
before we became a sorry cop

15
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:50,591
all that's coming up

16
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,445
so let's jump back in

17
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:57,125
oh there it is there it is we are back

18
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,425
we're so back

19
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,256
and I'm so excited

20
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:07,001
okay so we are back in the game now

21
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,291
 I just wanted to say

22
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:16,291
the community that has arrived around this game and specifically

23
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,225
this playthrough continues to amaze me

24
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:22,958
especially after last episode was like a lot of politics talk

25
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:29,325
and I was very like anxious avoidant of talking about politics

26
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:33,591
I have been very encouraged by the response to that last episode to like

27
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,191
not be so anxious about it

28
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:38,758
I don't I still don't know

29
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,525
if I'm gonna like start getting full political

30
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:47,725
but I will try not to to like avoid it in the game because of my personal

31
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,191
issues with getting political

32
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:53,591
I'll just say that

33
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,570
I won't let it divert the game

34
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,825
 because at the end of the day I want to talk about like mental health

35
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:04,525
and there's probably some interesting avenues in the narrative of the game

36
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,069
that will miss out on if I just totally ignore it

37
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:10,091
however I will say this game is

38
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,998
so wonderfully designed that you

39
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,158
you have a main character who has a real backstory

40
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:20,225
he's not like a blank slate

41
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,958
like I thought that he was gonna be from the beginning

42
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,491
he has his own backstory and at the same time

43
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:30,525
it allows you to have your own beliefs

44
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:36,525
and the character will like have the same behavioral patterns

45
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,891
like genuinely imagine

46
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,847
if like literally Brady was the detective

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,158
 imagine

48
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,251
what you know about me so far

49
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,025
 I would go about solving a murder

50
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,158
would be exactly like you've seen it

51
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,925
like I would spend crazy amounts of time

52
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:59,851
on things that you just wouldn't like you
