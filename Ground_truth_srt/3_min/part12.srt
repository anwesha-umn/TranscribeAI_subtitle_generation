00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:01,250
hello

2
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:05,225
and welcome to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,125
on today's episode we are meeting what has become

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:12,116
another one of my absolute favorite characters that we've met so far

5
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,425
so we're gonna be talking a lot with Annette and her mother today

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,925
learning more about the economic reality

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,675
of being a child who has to work out in the cold all day

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,400
and in that dialogue we're also gonna be continuing to build our own character profile

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:33,750
sort of continuing the analysis using the JaharI window that we started in the last episode

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:38,750
there's a lot of emotions to dig into and discuss in today's episode

11
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,684
including some that may come up when we finally face ourselves

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,100
so that's where we're at I'm excited to continue so

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,425
let's jump back in

14
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:48,925
okay

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,366
what shall we do next

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,017
I guess we can go enter the green the door behind the greenhouse

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,133
let's go do that

18
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,200
it's in the yard basement door is that back there

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,411
yeah it's more useful in counseling

20
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,075
what's this girl up to it's been a while since we've checked in

21
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:36,275
every snowflake is like a little gift from the sky

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
she is way too positive

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
oh it's snowing

24
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:48,600
what is this crime business

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,450
crime fiction is about murders or burglaries or things like that

26
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,533
and the work of a policeman or a private detective

27
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,675
who's trying to solve a crime and catch the criminals

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,966
I need to know what *crime* is

29
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,350
it's that bad (point to your head)

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,175
crime is what we were solving before this conversation began

31
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,300
why would anyone want to *read* about crime

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,450
it's exciting to people I guess

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,966
they get to imagine dangerous things

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,025
and it's kind of like a puzzle where you can guess who the criminal is

35
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,300
or how the good guys are going to catch him

36
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,875
i'm a policeman myself by the way

37
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,900
you don't look much like a policeman

38
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,933
I know

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,075
well what does a cop look like then

40
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,600
didn't mean to offend sir sorry sir

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,300
it's just that you don't look like Dick Mullen

42
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,875
she points to a book cover on which you can see strapping Vespertine officer

43
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,166
he stands grimly over the body of a dead woman

44
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,533
you know nobody actually looks like the guy in the picture

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
it's not your body that's important in police work

46
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,266
it's your head
