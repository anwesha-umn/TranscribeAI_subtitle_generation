00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:01,133
hello

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,733
and welcome back to my therapist plays

3
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:05,733
Disco Elysium analysis series

4
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:06,933
so on today's episode

5
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,833
we are delving even deeper into the psychology of

6
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,166
our main character

7
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,000
as this case gets more complicated

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,166
so does our relationship with ourselves

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,866
because we're also going to start

10
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,266
discovering more about who we were and

11
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:25,466
finding that we are not so happy with that person

12
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,600
before we had amnesia

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,800
and woke up as the person we are today

14
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:30,766
and so what does it mean

15
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:32,500
to be faced with some of those challenges

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,700
do we avoid them and try to shut them out

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,100
or do we look for

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,566
healthy ways to integrate them and move forward

19
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:44,566
but we also do get into a major confrontation

20
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,100
we're going to face

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,166
what it is like when we go up

22
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,666
against an individual named Measurehead

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,866
who stands between us and

24
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,533
our next objective in solving the case

25
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,600
so all that is coming up in today's episode and

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,500
perhaps our first moments of

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
genuine trust starting to build between ourselves and our partner Kim

28
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,700
I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you so

29
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:11,066
let's jump in

30
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,300
hey there's a big gentleman

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,233
bastards

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,900
we have a right to work

33
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,066
maybe this is the gentleman who

34
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,300
was asking about our case is a large lad

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:37,966
what's going on here

36
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,733
hold up and stay frosty everyone

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,700
cops are here

38
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,666
the broad shouldered alpha male turns to you

39
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,733
he's a full head taller than everybody else here

40
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,200
you here to fuck with us

41
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:52,333
beat the honest worker down

42
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,200
why should I

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,700
we're here to fight for a cause

44
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,333
stripes usually have problems with people who have causes

45
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,300
okay then I think I

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,433
I think no I want to be on your team friend

47
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:09,900
good

48
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,066
we're fighting for a cause here

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,366
right to work

50
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,800
right to work

51
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:17,933
besides

52
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,400
we're not that different

53
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,766
it helps if people see us talking

54
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,866
cops and strikebringers together

55
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,566
shows authorities around our side

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,800
builds confidence

57
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,366
I like his perspective I agree

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I agree with that

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,866
I think it's also kind of a power play that

60
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm like grinding the flashlight in everybody's face

61
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,600
because it makes them feel like I'm really targeting them

62
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,333
which is good for my interrogation

63
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,566
what kind of problems are we talking about

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,593
rights of workers to have gainful employment

65
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:53,766
 to make a salary

66
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:56,133
and feed their families

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,066
well I don't want to politically align with him
