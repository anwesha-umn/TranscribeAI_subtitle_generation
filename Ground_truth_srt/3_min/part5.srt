00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:01,066
hello

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,133
and welcome back to our therapist plays Disco Elysium

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,200
let's play if you're new here

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
hello my name is Brady

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,933
I'm a therapist

6
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,100
and we're doing kind of like a long forum

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,333
psychoanalysis of our main character

8
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,607
and all of the people that we meet in

9
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:21,166
our twisted weird journey through Revachol in Disco Elysium

10
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,200
so on today's episode we're kind of getting

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,760
deeper into the analysis

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,472
and actually kind of targeting our companion Kim

13
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:32,218
who at least in my play through

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,581
and the way I'm sort of role playing this character

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,360
we don't have like the most trusting relationship with yet and

16
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,566
kind of getting into the psychology of like

17
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,733
what does it mean to

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,800
want to trust someone

19
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,130
but not be sure if you can yet

20
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,400
and how does

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,200
someone who has a lot of like prior trauma

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,133
like our main character does

23
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:57,100
actually evaluate whether or not someone

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,472
who promises to be there on your side

25
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:02,930
is actually trustworthy in what they say

26
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,266
so today I'm going to give you

27
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,829
kind of a mix of psychological theory behind this idea

28
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:07,621
and also

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,290
how I would actually address something like this

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,283
in practice as a therapist

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,660
so with that is

32
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:14,760
let's continue

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,300
so

34
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,680
what do I need to do

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,789
I need to ask okay I need to solve this murder

36
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:29,560
I gotta be honest like the

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,472
the murder is like the lowest priority thing

38
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:34,167
to my character right now

39
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:38,618
I genuinely believe that if I'm this character

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,629
the murder is just a vehicle

41
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,912
to discover more about who I was

42
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,730
and in that process

43
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:50,460
reckoning with the idea that I may have done something

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,807
to myself to try to forget that person

45
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:53,890
and here I'm spending a lot of time

46
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,265
trying to figure that out

47
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,781
I could go do

48
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:04,766
I can go do the autopsy

49
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,566
I have the gloves and I have the form

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,003
maybe I should do that

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,566
the size of it to do list

52
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,000
I know I'm just collecting tasks

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,392
jam mystery

54
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,261
I kind of want to go see the body

55
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,861
let's do the autopsy real quick

56
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,723
I have all the ingredients I need

57
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:34,930
let's see what happens

58
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:45,250
maybe it will tell us something provide us information

59
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,458
the rotting man lies on his side

60
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,396
with his eyes looking straight through you

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,260
the belt is still around his neck

62
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:59,200
his body is supplying and open to intrusion by autopsy
