1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:01,066
okay

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,233
hello

3
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:06,166
and welcome back to our playthrough of disco elysium

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,466
we just finished kind of like the first little chunk of the game

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
kind of starting our character

6
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,653
and yeah just figuring out who he is

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,608
in this wild disgusting world

8
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:26,790
and how wild and disgusting are we going to be to

9
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:28,933
kind of meet the world where it's at

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,237
so I've sort of decided that the character profile

11
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,351
we're going with is like

12
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:39,266
ex or failed therapist turned dirty cop

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,000
kind of the idea like

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,733
I tried to be a therapist

15
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:47,660
but I found it was too easy to manipulate people

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,500
or the more I learned about people

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,366
the more I could not help the urge to exploit that stuff

18
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,787
so I became a cop instead

19
00:00:56,107 --> 00:01:01,467
where I can hide behind a moral or duty justification

20
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:04,563
for getting information from people

21
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:05,997
and I can sort of code that as

22
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,797
this is a good thing for me and them

23
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:11,097
I'm actually protecting them by figuring out their dark secrets

24
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:12,763
so that's kind of where we're at

25
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,400
let's continue

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,623
keep working on this crime here

27
00:01:24,697 --> 00:01:26,966
literally just came back at the perfect time hell yeah

28
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:28,733
let's fucking go

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,696
okay let's check out the crime scene a little bit more here

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,233
get some cash lying around

31
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,733
never gonna let that go to waste

32
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,533
some more magnesium

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,900
I'm thinking we're gonna need to stock up on magnesium

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,866
this winch mechanism has been oxidating for some years

35
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,600
the kids ladder is climbable

36
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,133
okay not too much interesting going on around here

37
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,566
let's check out the body

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,133
...with bulging white eyes

39
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,266
the face around them does not look human

40
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,933
it's swollen and ready to burst

41
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,875
his lips are fish like

42
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,933
and his tongue like a bull gag in his mouth

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,366
pretty gruesome

44
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,500
you seem to be holding your breath

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,666
a cargo belt twists his neck at an unnatural angle

46
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,866
the body below appears stiff

47
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,166
it's letting out an ungodly rot

48
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:42,333
the smell seeps in even through your clenched nostrils

49
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,900
legendary let go of your nose without throwing up

50
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,133
that 17 percent

51
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,111
has not steered me wrong yet
