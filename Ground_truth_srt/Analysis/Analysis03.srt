1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,420
Okay, let's talk about why we make bad decisions.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,550
So if you're like me, then you've probably been

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,450
in that situation where it's the end of the day

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,740
or it's the morning and you're thinking like,

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,700
okay, I'm gonna make a solid plan for myself.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,340
Today, I'm gonna be disciplined.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,400
I'm gonna come home from work

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
and I'm gonna get all these errands done

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,030
and I'm gonna treat myself really well.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,560
I'm gonna make a nice healthy, proper meal.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,260
I'm gonna go to the gym afterwards.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,410
I'm gonna exercise and then maybe when I come home,

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,020
I'll like start reading a book or something.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,520
I'll do something a little different,

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,900
something that makes me feel like I'm gonna advance my life

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,060
in a new positive direction.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,450
And this is our real life volition

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,880
and it's there to lead you on your way

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,460
to making good life decisions.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
But this doesn't always work out that way.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,210
Sometimes you get to the end of the day

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,820
and you realize that you haven't been very disciplined.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,220
At all, a lot of those errands are still

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,020
incomplete or like half-started.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,220
We didn't end up going to the gym

26
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,400
and instead of making a proper meal,

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,600
we've ordered some definitely not healthy takeout food.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,240
And instead of reading that book,

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,080
maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
and we've not advanced our life

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,120
in a positive meaningful direction in any way at all.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,980
What is happening here?

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,720
Why would we ignore the voice of volition

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,920
that's telling us to do all of these

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
beneficial positive things?

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,780
Well, it could be a lot of things honestly

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,760
and definitely having like a mental health diagnosis

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,040
is going to amplify this problem a lot more.

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,560
But even for the average person,

40
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,300
this happens like pretty often.

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,180
I mean, it certainly happens to me.

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,270
So what I wanted to share with you today

43
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,340
is a framework for understanding why this problem happens

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,980
and what we can actually do about it.

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,640
This is a real problem that actually comes up

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,780
in my work as a therapist kind of often.

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,220
And I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,600
so clearly and given such a unique role

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,400
within the structure of a game like Disco Elysium has.

50
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,300
So okay, there is a reason that we do not always follow

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,120
the voice of volition and go through

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,380
with our good intentions.

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,420
And it has to do with something called psychological friction.

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,280
So in this context, friction is any force

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,220
either internal or external,

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,900
which opposes a behavioral change.

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,690
So what do we know about like regular friction, right?

58
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,400
If I am standing on an ice rink

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,570
and I move my body weight around a little bit,

60
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,560
I'm gonna start sliding around on the ice.

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,560
There's not a lot of friction between me

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,040
and the surface that's under me.

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,300
When I step off the ice and now I'm standing on concrete,

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,970
when I shift myself around, I don't move, right?

65
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,920
There is a lot more friction between me and the ground.

66
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,880
And psychologically, this principle

67
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,460
is basically the same thing.

68
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,780
If you imagine you're trying to do something,

69
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,100
it's going to be much harder

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,630
if there is more friction between you and the process

71
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,560
and it's going to be much easier

72
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,180
if there is less friction.

73
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,480
When friction is introduced

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,540
and we'll talk about what kinds of friction are very common,

75
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,500
the process tends to slow down.

76
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,140
We tend to have a harder time

77
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,020
actually completing the thing we're trying to do.

78
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,740
And it's much more likely that we're going to give up.

79
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,240
When there is less friction

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
or we find a way to reduce the friction that's there,

81
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,690
the process can start to speed up again

82
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,760
and we'll find more motivation

83
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,620
to actually keep working on it.

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,070
And really we can kind of think of this

85
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,880
how like habits work, right?

86
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
When you're trying to do something new,

87
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,880
it can be hard to stay motivated and be consistent

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,820
and be very disciplined in it.

89
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,700
We have to be very rigorous and consistent with things

90
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,780
before they start to get easier

91
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,100
and we have to do less work to get ourselves

92
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,550
in the mindset to do it.

93
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,020
Like if we're trying to start, you know,

94
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,740
an exercise, regimen or something.

95
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,820
So there's a lot of friction between us

96
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,520
and this new behavioral change.

97
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,450
Things start to get easier when we learn more about that process

98
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,670
and we start developing sort of like the mental tricks

99
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,490
to get ourselves into that kind of mode

100
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,720
where we want to do it.

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,830
We don't have to convince ourselves anymore

102
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,050
and our stamina to like do the thing that's difficult

103
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,310
starts to go up and there's a lot less friction here.

104
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,470
We start to develop that habit

105
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,050
when the process becomes streamlined and simplified

106
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,090
and we have to do less of the psychological work

107
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,490
to get ourselves moving on it.

108
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,890
So basically the things that we tend to do the most

109
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,670
and the patterns of behavior that we tend to repeat

110
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,770
are those where the amount of friction between us

111
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,770
and the process is very minimal.

112
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,190
So this is part of why when we tell ourselves

113
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,310
we're going to do all of these nice things,

114
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,730
a lot of friction tends to get introduced in that process

115
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,190
because thinking about doing all of those things

116
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,110
isn't really that hard, but when it comes down to it,

117
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,030
it takes an extra layer of scheduling and timing

118
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,420
and trying to balance your energy throughout the day.

119
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,730
You better make sure that you slept enough,

120
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,090
ate well enough to that you're hydrated,

121
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,410
that you actually have the motivation at the time

122
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,590
you're trying to do that thing to actually start it.

123
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,940
And honestly, at the end of a long day,

124
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,590
we're not typically still in the high motivation state

125
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,160
that we were at the beginning of the day

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,190
when volition was telling us how awesome

127
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,510
we're gonna be sometime later.

128
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,890
We are not always interested or capable sometimes

129
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,350
of fighting against all of the friction

130
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,910
that has found us along the way.

131
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,630
So we choose things that are less difficult, right?

132
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,950
The kinds of habits that we've already formed

133
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,710
that we know work that don't require a lot

134
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,750
of mental fortitude to carry out.

135
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,430
Volition asks us to do things which are good for us

136
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,970
but that they are difficult to accomplish.

137
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,640
And so it's often the voices of half light

138
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,090
or electrochemistry that give us other options

139
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,290
and don't ask us to fight against a bunch of friction.

140
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,670
They just want us to chase whatever impulse

141
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,130
makes sense in the moment.

142
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,290
You should tell people to f*** off more often.

143
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,150
I should, I should do that.

144
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,910
You shouldn't.

145
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,710
You're an officer of the law.

146
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,690
Maybe I shouldn't.

147
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,330
So this has been really fascinating to see portrayed

148
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,970
in disco-alecium because in my playthrough,

149
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,050
I've been kind of role-playing and demonstrating

150
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,100
this whole problem, right?

151
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,560
And so sometimes volition will chime in with a thought

152
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,530
and I just ignore it.

153
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,990
And I go do something that for a lot of people,

154
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,200
it looks like it's not really within my character's best interest

155
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,830
and they're right.

156
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,510
But that's how people are.

157
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,550
We are kind of walking contradictions.

158
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,550
We just don't always act in our own best interests.

159
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,790
Like I said, even though the thought

160
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,650
to do something good is available to us,

161
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,190
that doesn't mean we're actually going to do it.

162
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,170
In fact, we're very keenly aware,

163
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,530
a lot of the times, that we are doing something

164
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,970
that's not in our best interest.

165
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,100
And we're pulling the ice cream out of the fridge

166
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,600
and telling ourselves along the way,

167
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,890
I really shouldn't.

168
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,070
But I'm gonna anyway.

169
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,660
So this is a real problem, right?

170
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,370
And the game is so good at demonstrating this.

171
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,460
So what do you do about this, right?

172
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,920
I like the word friction because it gives us

173
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,210
a very easy framework to understand.

174
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,890
And so when I'm working with someone

175
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,530
who is struggling with motivation

176
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,070
or a lot of times we're sort of questioning,

177
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,350
like I'm very passionate about this thing,

178
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,470
but I don't find myself doing it a lot.

179
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,660
Like I don't know what's wrong with me.

180
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,130
Maybe I've lost interest in it.

181
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,020
That's where we may start to ask the question, okay,

182
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,680
well, what kind of friction is in this process for you

183
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,660
and how might we start to work to reduce it?

184
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,510
And the best place to start is actually trying to understand

185
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,230
whether this friction is even real or not,

186
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,850
because that's the thing.

187
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,690
There is real psychological friction

188
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,170
and perceived psychological friction.

189
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,950
Now, that is not to say that friction by itself

190
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,430
is a bad thing.

191
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,230
In fact, there are some cases where introducing friction

192
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,570
to some sort of behavioral process is actually a good thing.

193
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,710
Think about an addiction, for example, right?

194
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,770
Which is a big part of dysgoelisium,

195
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,210
where the habit to seek and use a substance

196
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,360
has become very normalized for us,

197
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,640
and we're always looking to have the least amount of friction

198
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,860
between us and continuing that substance use.

199
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,650
And so actually, when you're trying to work on breaking a habit

200
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,270
or lower the chances that an addiction develops,

201
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,170
you actually want to introduce friction to the process.

202
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,560
Essentially, making things harder is going to slow down

203
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,130
and make completely interrupt the process

204
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,570
that we are trying to change.

205
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,770
This is why when people are trying to quit a substance,

206
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,330
they typically go to a detox center

207
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,070
and then they go into full rehabilitation.

208
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,030
And that's to completely separate themselves

209
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,930
from the environment and all of the social and psychological

210
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,850
issues which made repeating that pattern of behavior very easy.

211
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,210
We want to introduce a ton of friction

212
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,970
to this person's life temporarily,

213
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,230
so that we can learn to develop better strategies

214
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,750
to cope with the issues that resulted in some sort of addiction.

215
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,930
So this was all pretty well demonstrated in my own playthrough

216
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,860
in which we spent a lot of time trying to find a way

217
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,330
to buy a pack of cigarettes.

218
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,510
And I was explaining how when we have a chemical dependence

219
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,930
on something, we're often going to prioritize that

220
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,910
over most other things, higher order things,

221
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,790
like solving a crime or strengthening our relationships.

222
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,340
And so the thought pattern may have been something like,

223
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,730
okay, well, our character wants to smoke.

224
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,260
How do I do that?

225
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,900
What's the simplest path here?

226
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,620
I want to find the way with the least amount of friction

227
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,090
like I need this now.

228
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,690
So we go into Frita and Frita Girl is there, okay?

229
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,850
And she tells us that we don't have the money for cigarettes.

230
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,610
There's a way that we can get the money for cigarettes.

231
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,990
What we can do is we can collect tear.

232
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,280
And tear is trash.

233
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,850
And so what we can do is try to find a bag

234
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,190
so that we can pick up all the tear and revisher

235
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,630
and we'll spend as much time as we need to collecting this

236
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,760
so that we can go and buy the cigarettes.

237
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,770
And that sounds like kind of a difficult drawn out process.

238
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,950
And it was, however, there was less friction in doing that

239
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,730
than there would be if I tried to solve this murder

240
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,730
without the stimulant that my body is craving.

241
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,030
I may have been telling myself, like, look,

242
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,640
this whole detective thing is just way too hard

243
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,870
without a buzz, right?

244
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,220
There's too much friction.

245
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,350
I can't talk to people.

246
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,950
I can't think straight, right?

247
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,910
I'm gonna do this other thing that's still difficult,

248
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,990
but maybe it will help reduce the amount of friction

249
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,460
in this other bigger, more difficult task.

250
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,510
And then we'll go do it.

251
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,050
And that is an example of totally made up

252
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,730
perceived fake friction, right?

253
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,740
Like, smoking cigarettes doesn't actually make us

254
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,680
a better detective.

255
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,280
Like, it gives us maybe a false sense

256
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,470
of like plus one to our intellect.

257
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,770
But we may have convinced ourselves as, you know,

258
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,890
many people who are struggling with substances do

259
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,040
that we are inadequate or unable to perform a certain task

260
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,370
without this thing.

261
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,540
And so like, we look at that and say,

262
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,550
no, there's too much friction.

263
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,670
I can't do that.

264
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,690
It's too hard.

265
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,190
Having this substance will make it easier.

266
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,970
When really what we have done is just choose something

267
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,340
that's equally hard and we're reinforcing a bad pattern

268
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,930
of behavior.

269
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,490
And one that's pretty bad for us.

270
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,810
So that was a demonstration of the perceived kind of friction,

271
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,270
right?

272
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,410
Then this happened again,

273
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,590
nearing the end of our first day in Revishal,

274
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,770
in which my character had also been searching for ways

275
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,290
to drink alcohol.

276
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,820
And so we come to the end of the day

277
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,230
and we hadn't really found any opportunities

278
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,370
to do that besides like licking some alcohol

279
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,170
off of a table.

280
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,800
But so we're standing there at the end of the day

281
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,530
and we're talking to Gart, who is the manager

282
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,070
of the whirling and rags.

283
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,390
And we're asking him, like, can I buy a drink?

284
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,230
Look, I've had a long day, OK?

285
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,790
I spent most of it looking for cigarettes

286
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,530
and then I did a little bit of detective work

287
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,270
and it has tired me out, OK?

288
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,740
Now I need the other substance that I'm

289
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,750
depended on to sleep all of this off.

290
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,410
And that's when Gart tells us like, dude,

291
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,750
I'm not the bartender, OK?

292
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,890
I don't actually serve drinks here.

293
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,950
Find another way to get drunk.

294
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,750
You know what?

295
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,520
The impact of rejection is stronger

296
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,980
than the impulse to drink from my guy right now,

297
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,020
as a sorry cop.

298
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,590
I abandon, I'm going to abandon the desire to drink

299
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,690
because I am too ashamed to ask further.

300
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,980
He effectively made it more difficult for us to do this.

301
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,830
And in my mind, in simulating the character's perspective,

302
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,690
we decided that this was just too much work, right?

303
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,590
Like, we're already tired enough.

304
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,970
Who knows how much more time and effort and money

305
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,550
this was going to take to get some alcohol, right?

306
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,270
And so we gave up.

307
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,550
There was too much friction introduced to the process.

308
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,330
It would involve talking to people.

309
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,670
It would have involved budgeting.

310
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,170
It would have involved embarrassing ourselves even more.

311
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,830
And so with a lot of friction introduced to the process,

312
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,110
this slowed down and has the potential

313
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,010
to completely interrupt the problem behavior.

314
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,090
So I just find this whole thing fascinating

315
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,510
that the voice of a listen represents what is in real life,

316
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,140
which is just our good intentions to make healthy,

317
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,210
balanced decisions for ourselves.

318
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,850
And yet, typically the things that it wants us to do

319
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,210
require a lot of effort, a lot of deep behavioral changes.

320
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,410
And there are often a lot of barriers in between us

321
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,110
and doing them.

322
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,430
And here you have like other voices, which

323
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,130
have not so great intentions for us in competition

324
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:07,890
with volition.

325
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,190
And there's way less friction involved in those.

326
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,290
And so we chase those impulses even though we know we shouldn't.

327
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,990
That is just real life.

328
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,530
And I love disco elicin for this.

329
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,550
It's been one of my favorite parts of the game so far.

330
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,250
So what can you take away from this?

331
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,530
Well, consider a change that you've

332
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,310
been trying to make recently or a habit

333
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,320
that you're trying to break.

334
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,070
And ask yourself, what is the friction involved

335
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,210
in this process?

336
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,030
What is making it hard for me to make this good change?

337
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,280
And is that a real source of friction

338
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,850
or is it one that I'm kind of like perceiving?

339
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,340
Because at the end of the day, we

340
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,130
choose to ignore a volition even though we know it's there

341
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,780
and that it actually wants something better for us.

342
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,490
I genuinely think that making a change

343
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,950
is not always about working harder at something.

344
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,910
In fact, a lot of times I think

345
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,260
it's about making the process easier, right?

346
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,870
Simpler, streamlined, with the least amount of friction.

347
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,710
And you may find that over time, just like any other habit,

348
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,610
the more you train yourself to detect and resolve

349
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,470
the sources of friction in your life,

350
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,450
you actually find it a little easier

351
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,590
to listen to volition when it talks to you.

352
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,130
So that is why we ignore volition in real life.

353
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,890
I am very curious to hear what all of you think about this.

354
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,540
And if there's anything that you can think of that

355
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,360
is a source of friction in your life

356
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,730
that you may not even even really know is there.

357
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,630
So far, disco-alecium has been amazing at bringing

358
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,830
together real mental health with practical game mechanics.

359
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,490
And I find that really fun to talk about.

360
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,410
So I'm also curious if there's other games and other systems

361
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,730
in them that you think would be worthy of this kind of analysis

362
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,390
as well.

363
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,190
I don't know.

364
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,530
Maybe this could be like a series or something

365
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,930
where we talk about the crossover between game design

366
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,950
and mental health and how mechanics

367
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,760
can represent real cognitive structures

368
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,350
that we use and deal with every day.

369
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,210
So thank you for watching my video.

370
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,450
I hope you enjoyed it.

371
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,790
Yeah, let me know if you'd like to hear more of this kind

372
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,350
of discussion with other game mechanics.

373
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,210
And if you want to see more of where these ideas

374
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,890
are kind of taking shape and the discussions

375
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,730
we're having about them, we're currently

376
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,990
uploading a full Let's Play of disco-alecium

377
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,770
with lots of psychological analysis intermixed in that.

378
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,100
So subscribe if you want to catch those

379
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,130
as they release or other standalone analyses like this one.

380
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,970
Right now, these two are the friction between me

381
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,290
and finishing this video.

382
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,020
It's OK.

383
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,720
I love them.

384
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,400
So with that said, I will see you guys next time.

385
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,360
I'm going to go try to make some of my own good decisions

386
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,180
right now.
