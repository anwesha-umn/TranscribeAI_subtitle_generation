1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,133
okay

2
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:02,866
hello

3
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:04,241
and welcome to

4
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:08,166
kind of like a special little interlude episode that

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,700
I wanted to put out before

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,166
the next Disco Elysium stream goes live

7
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,400
so this is something I may do from time to time

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,533
kind of like taking

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,666
a chunk of the analysis and putting it in its own video

10
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,000
sometimes because it takes me a while

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,866
to sort of collect my thoughts on things

12
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:22,766
and it doesn't always happen

13
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,566
like while we're live on stream 

14
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,066
but also because

15
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,600
I can kind of already foresee that this

16
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,800
playthrough of Disco Elysium is going to be

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,366
quite long going at our usual pace

18
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,000
and I know it can be pretty hard to get into

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,966
a let's play

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,066
when it's like episode 30

21
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:44,166
or something and so if you weren't really

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,766
there for the beginning of it

23
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,133
it's kinda hard to hop in

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,800
that far down the line so

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
I thought it would be cool to kind of like do

26
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
like little chunks of our

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,166
character studies and

28
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,640
like analysis of the games

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,133
 systems like how they represent different

30
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,533
parts of mental health like

31
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,166
just as their own separate videos

32
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,933
basically for the people who can't commit the time to watch 

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
all of the let's play videos or

34
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,366
can't make it to the streams or that sort of thing

35
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,700
they can still enjoy

36
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:14,200
kind of the psychological breakdown parts of it so

37
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,366
that's what we're gonna be doing today

38
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,466
there's something that

39
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:19,000
I have to talk about basically like

40
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,100
I just couldn't really wait until

41
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,733
the next time I get on stream to talk about it

42
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,066
so that's what we're gonna do now

43
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:28,725
okay so there is something that Disco Elysium does 

44
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:32,375
in its portrayal of a very specific aspect of mental health 

45
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,366
 that I have never seen portrayed this way

46
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:36,500
anywhere else

47
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,933
so one of the biggest challenges when talking about

48
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,966
anything related to mental health

49
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,675
whether depression mental illness addiction 

50
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:46,900
is it can sometimes be really hard to explain

51
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,000
how can you want something 

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,650
you could desperately want to not be depressed 

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,900
you can desperately want to be sober

54
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:01,400
and yet sometimes our behaviors really don't agree with that desire 

55
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,600
and how you explain that to someone that

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,166
you sitting there wondering like

57
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,333
all I want in the world is to stop using

58
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,866
but I just can't

59
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,000
and this is kind of

60
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,466
you know a mentality that I imagine like our

61
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,866
lead detective

62
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,366
having been in at some point

63
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,133
before he lost his memory

64
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,666
and at least in my playthrough

65
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,733
it's something he's still struggling with right

66
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,866
as he does whatever he can find a pack of cigarettes

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,133
and for me it comes down to this

68
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,200
we tend to have a very limited

69
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,933
way of talking about the subject of motivation

70
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,800
like why you actually do things why you want things

71
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,266
and this is where Disco Elysium comes into the picture

72
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:42,166
with these different aspects of the main character psyche who 

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,966
seem to have different

74
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,766
motivations for him

75
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,066
and they influence you as the player to sort of

76
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,700
follow different paths

77
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,666
one motivation in terms of the authority voice will tell you like 

78
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,866
you need to smack that kid right

79
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,066
don't let Cuno get one over you like that

80
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,366
and then at the same time

81
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,400
the voice coming from place of empathy might tell you

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
you know Cuno probably doesn't really have 

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
anyone to look after him either

84
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,300
and one of the only ways that he has to express himself 

85
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,741
because he doesn't have a sense of control at home 

86
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:16,900
is to be vulgar

87
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,566
and he gets a reaction from people

88
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,333
may go home and find that

89
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,866
no one really pays attention to him

90
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,500
and this is how he gets that

91
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,733
this is his outlet

92
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,900
and so my character can have these two

93
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,533
very different perspectives

94
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,933
offering him a different kind of motivation

95
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,333
one that says slap the shit out of this

96
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,966
and the other that says actually

97
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:39,500
the two of you are probably not too dissimilar

98
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,825
you both feel this absence of connection to the world around you

99
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:45,166
and you're both trying to express

100
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,166
that longing for connection in different ways

101
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,866
so this is complicated right

102
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,525
it's not always easy to explain to people

103
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,766
 why you can have two thoughts that don't necessarily agree

104
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,800
one that says I want to be sober

105
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,866
one that says

106
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:02,266
go get as high as you can right now right

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
so I'm going to pull this up here

108
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,800
I've got the skill system

109
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,791
these are all the different like voices 

110
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:15,066
that you tend to hear in the characters dialogue

111
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,100
and this is the part

112
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,066
where Disco Elysium really gets something very right

113
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,100
about how to explain these

114
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,700
different sources of motivation

115
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,800
that don't always agree

116
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,800
and what it comes down to is that

117
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,766
we have this word

118
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:31,733
motivation

119
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,225
but I always come back to this idea that like 

120
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:38,400
motivation by itself this word it doesn't really explain

121
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,566
what I just talked about

122
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:44,850
like the fact that you can have different sources of desires 

123
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,333
that are not always in harmony with one another

124
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,800
to use this word is to say oh I didn't

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,700
do it because I wasn't motivated right

126
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,933
I didn't get up early enough

127
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,866
because I didn't have enough motivation to do it

128
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,066
I didn't go to the gym today

129
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,166
because I just didn't have the motivation for it

130
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,533
like it tries to explain

131
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,266
desire and action potential as like

132
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,100
a one to one relationship

133
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,000
my problem with this word is that it is very

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,200
one dimensional

135
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,966
so if we just think of like the start of the game right

136
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,766
at the very beginning the character wakes up and

137
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,066
like where is his center of motivation at

138
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,157
the first thing that we kind of learn about him 

139
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:24,966
is that he is like not really aware of what's going on 

140
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,900
like his primary motivation

141
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,200
as the player being the character is to like

142
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,366
figure out where you are and like

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
get a grasp on the world right

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,766
my first instinct when I loaded up the character

145
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:38,566
was like

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,500
look around at the things that you can find to like

147
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,100
wear his clothes like defend yourself right

148
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:48,766
and so like one of my motivations is safety

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,666
at the same time

150
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,666
he starts getting pulled into like

151
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,566
even more complicated motivations

152
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:58,133
like he tries to get the tie down from the fan

153
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,700
and here we have Inland Empire

154
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,533
telling us that like the tie is

155
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,066
not just your tie but it's also potentially your

156
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,533
long lost cosmic best friend right

157
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,500
and so

158
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,500
his motivation

159
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:15,766
shifts from safety to a sense of belonging

160
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,333
you reach up for the tie and your body is like

161
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,966
actually you can't reach for it

162
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,900
like that hurts too much right

163
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,800
and so it's kind of winding back to safety

164
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:26,500
me as the character

165
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,200
I was like all right

166
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,900
well this is a higher priority to me right now

167
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:30,766
than belonging

168
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,000
so I left the tie there

169
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,266
this does not mean that I'm not motivated to

170
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,133
have a sense of belonging

171
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:41,666
it just means that there is a priority structure that

172
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,700
interferes with itself sometimes

173
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,175
so I really don't think that the word itself motivation

174
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:51,600
 really explains the psychodynamic issue at play here right

175
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,266
the better way that I try to explain this to my clients

176
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,166
is that we can be in different

177
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:03,100
mental states that are in competition with one another

178
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,466
so instead of talking about like

179
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,900
your lack of action potential as

180
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,966
you just didn't want to do something

181
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:14,600
like you didn't really want to be sober so you relapsed 

182
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,325
instead we try to formulate it in terms of 

183
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:20,168
we have different mental states

184
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:22,366
 that are in competition with one another

185
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,766
so we have competing mental states

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,100
and this is where Disco Elysium really nails that idea

187
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:33,566
because here you have a mental state 

188
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,266
called empathy that is telling you

189
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,166
you need to make this your priority

190
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,900
you need to connect to something

191
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,066
as you awake from the void of nothingness

192
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:47,733
and the only thing active in your brain is the reptilian side of you 

193
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:50,133
like you need emotional grounding

194
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:52,966
you need to find something that anchors you to

195
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,166
not just like who you were

196
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,400
but who you are and what you feel right now

197
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,900
at the same time

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
there are parts of his body right his electrochemistry

199
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
all that stuff I talked about with like the

200
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,800
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system

201
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:14,200
that are rejecting what empathy commands of you 

202
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:17,800
and so electrochemistry is like in competition with

203
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,166
empathy for your priority structure

204
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,200
then we have things like logic enter the picture right

205
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,366
the logical side of his brain is like okay

206
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,700
well search for things that

207
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,600
are a compromise to this

208
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,533
go find your shoe

209
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:35,466
you don't have to like reach up and grab the tie right

210
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:38,700
you can still satisfy safety by finding your shoes

211
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:42,200
perception comes into play and is like hey 

212
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,300
why don't you check out the window right

213
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,533
and then the more you are sort of exerting yourself

214
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,933
like your endurance and your pain threshold

215
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,500
like they start vying for

216
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,400
territory over your decision making to say like

217
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,533
actually you don't really need that much Protection

218
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,666
like you're good enough with one shoe right

219
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,700
and so like your decision making

220
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,166
is not just a one track

221
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,866
sort of line of like are you motivated to do this

222
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:09,400
do you want to do it then you do it

223
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,900
instead the way disco elysium kind of

224
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,366
depicts this and this is like a very accurate way of trying to explain 

225
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,966
the discord that happens in someone's mind

226
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,000
especially when they're

227
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,200
intoxicated or recovering from being intoxicated

228
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,766
is that you have all these different mental states that

229
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,400
are sort of vying for your attention

230
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,533
and are not always

231
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,066
in agreement with one another on what you should do

232
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,200
and so that causes a lot of inner tention

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
like I don't know about you

234
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,900
but when I feel overwhelmed by something

235
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:48,766
the main feeling that I have is one of avoidance 

236
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,966
I don't want to feel like I

237
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,500
am not in control of myself for my own decision making

238
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,866
so I'm going to listen to the ones that are basically

239
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,666
like the most impulsive right

240
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:00,293
electrochemistry is basically like threatening me 

241
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:02,400
 that if I don't do what it wants 

242
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,650
if I don't get the out of this environment 

243
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,530
or if I don't like get a cigarette right now

244
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,780
 that I'm going to die

245
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,666
right it's like convincing my body that

246
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,133
not smoking right now is the equivalent of like

247
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,933
being eaten alive by a predator

248
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,800
like that's what it's able to do because it's tapped

249
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,133
directly into my like spinal cord and

250
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,666
my entire like fighter flight response

251
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,100
and so you can imagine like

252
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,300
even for someone who is completely sober

253
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:34,300
and is just afflicted with the disease

254
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,100
of anxiety which we all are

255
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,900
this is a mess like we're all a total mess 

256
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,133
and it's really hard to like sort out

257
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,766
what our priorities should be at any given moment

258
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,966
just when we're stressed

259
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:50,500
a lot of people

260
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:54,366
don't want to have to spend the time to reflect

261
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,066
and sort this out and like

262
00:10:56,466 --> 00:11:00,307
learn how to develop like healthy communication 

263
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:03,366
between these two systems and many systems 

264
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:06,500
and so like what we often do is we resort to avoidance

265
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,666
like I'm just not gonna

266
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,333
participate in any of this

267
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,966
I'm just gonna go get fucked up instead right

268
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:14,100
I'm gonna listen to this one that tells me

269
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:14,933
if you don't

270
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,100
get on something to alleviate this stress right now

271
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
then the whole thing shuts down

272
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,300
so like right from the beginning

273
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,900
Disco elysium targets this

274
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,125
very complicated subject of motivation

275
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,500
 and gives us a framework for understanding like

276
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,766
as you go throughout the world

277
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,266
as you start talking to people

278
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:37,600
and as you start making decisions as a player like

279
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,400
you are also going to be

280
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,025
in contention with what these different systems ask of you 

281
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:45,133
 for like my character

282
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,800
his very much built in

283
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,133
this category

284
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,400
and these have different names as well in the game

285
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,200
so these ones are intellect these are psyche

286
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:57,500
physique

287
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,733
and Motorics

288
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:01,666
and so these are like

289
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,900
we can even just explain it that way to say that

290
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,079
these are kind of like the four main categories of mental states 

291
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,800
that are often vying for territory over your decision making

292
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,733
there's an intellectual side of you

293
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,000
that is telling you to make logical

294
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,100
clear decisions based on deduction and reasoning

295
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,900
but intellects

296
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:27,100
doesn't always agree with your psyche because

297
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:30,266
your psyche is the realm where your emotions live

298
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:34,625
like Inland Empire empathy authority volition

299
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,825
these are all like very emotional machines

300
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,925
that aren't always interested in solving problems

301
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:45,066
based on deduction and reasoning and observation

302
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,600
they are not as concerned

303
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,166
with the ideas

304
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,700
that perception might have in Motorix

305
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,766
about like how to solve a problem

306
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,566
they're going to rely more on emotional virtues

307
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,733
and so like they're gonna compete with each other

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,533
and

309
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:01,500
both of those systems are going to be competing with

310
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,366
physique because physique is basically managing like

311
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,466
the resources that the body has to

312
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
send off to these different corners right

313
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:12,466
physique is like

314
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,366
look you don't actually have the energy to go

315
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:15,466
get that tie down

316
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,333
even if it is your best friend

317
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,600
and Motorix

318
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,800
may be interfering with aspects of intellect

319
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,933
by saying like hey you

320
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,800
may perceive

321
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,733
lots of details you can tell there is something here

322
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:32,000
but you can't necessarily deduce

323
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,100
the best way to deal with it

324
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,133
that's kind of my character right like

325
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:40,100
he's he's able to like pass these really hard

326
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,800
perception rolls

327
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,133
but there's really not a lot of follow through with it

328
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
so as I was playing the game I just found this skill system amazing 

329
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,366
not only as like a parallel to real discussions

330
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,966
 that I have with people all the time about

331
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,600
like the complicated nature of motivation

332
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,500
and that motivation is not 

333
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,000
really even the subject that we're talking about

334
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,966
we're talking about competition between

335
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:10,133
several mental states that you can occupy all at the same time 

336
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,100
and that want different things from you

337
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,600
but this also works extremely well as a narrative device 

338
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,866
as a storytelling device

339
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,625
and as a game mechanic

340
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,966
 because these are the things that

341
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,341
as the player you're interfacing with 

342
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:27,533
when I'm like yeah well I'm specked into psyche

343
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,566
and so I'm probably gonna be more biased to follow what

344
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:35,040
Inland Empire is telling me I should focus on 

345
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,200
versus like something that my physique side is telling me

346
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,400
and really like using this system to

347
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,866
explain character motivations

348
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,566
doesn't just apply to the detective

349
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:49,300
think about Kim for a second all right Kim

350
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:52,466
he's our best boy right now

351
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:53,933
Kim

352
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,900
from the moment we meet him

353
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,400
has a complicated array of motivations as we do 

354
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,300
and he is way more stable than we are presumably

355
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,300
so I can imagine for Kim

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,100
that he's got a lot of different mental states 

357
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,366
that are in competition with one another as well

358
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,800
something that we learn

359
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,133
this might actually be in the second recording

360
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,266
I can't remember

361
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,266
but something we learn about him is that like

362
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,133
he does care about his work 

363
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,200
like he cares a lot about being a good detective like doing things the right way 

364
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,866
he has a lot of dignity and integrity and respect for himself 

365
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,400
but at the same time
还请略作宽容，观察主播对金的认知变化。

366
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,966
还请略作宽容，观察主播对金的认知变化。

367
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:45,500
I think he also presents as someone willing to bend his morals 
还请略作宽容，观察主播对金的认知变化。

368
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,300
if he knows he can accomplish
还请略作宽容，观察主播对金的认知变化。

369
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,666
something he is trying to do right
还请略作宽容，观察主播对金的认知变化。

370
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,100
because he also has this like
还请略作宽容，观察主播对金的认知变化。

371
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,358
还请略作宽容，观察主播对金的认知变化。

372
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,700
cultural side to him right

373
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,866
when we meet the racist lorry driver

374
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:57,000
right like we see

375
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,200
Kim himself

376
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,266
get in touch with some of these more like 

377
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,666
commanding mental states that

378
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,366
sort of break him from the facade of someone who is always 

379
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:13,100
cool and calm and collected

380
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:16,700
and he confronts this gentleman and like we see that

381
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,200
you know I think Kim would be

382
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,925
willing to compromise on some things

383
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,866
 if he knew that it would satisfy like his cultural desires right

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,066
so he's got two competing mental states there

385
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,133
just being around us is a competition between

386
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,300
his structured world and the

387
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:37,500
complete chaos that our character presents right

388
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,872
at the same time I think he also finds us useful

389
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:44,866
as someone he can wield to accomplish this

390
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,600
it's not just about competition between mental states

391
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,800
it's also about like

392
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,000
where do you start justifying what you compromise

393
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,466
and somewhere along the way I really think that

394
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,333
he does compromise logic and maybe his empathy and some of his volition 

395
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,133
like he compromises those things

396
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,300
to allow us to do our thing

397
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,533
in some ways maybe because he

398
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,200
he can relate to us

399
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,466
I think there's maybe a part of him that

400
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,866
is a little bit like

401
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,775
shackled by his structured way of being 

402
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:23,733
 and being around the detective vicariously he gets to experience

403
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,933
his own inner chaos

404
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:29,500
we are the conduit for him exploring

405
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,133
what would happen if I don't compete

406
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,800
and I don't try to win out

407
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,500
and I don't try to learn to communicate healthily

408
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
between any of these systems

409
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
what if I just embrace chaos and

410
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,200
follow whatever impulse comes to me right like

411
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:46,533
I don't think he can let himself do that and so

412
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,933
he allows the detective to do that right

413
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,850
that's what makes Detective Costeau and 

414
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,266
Kim great foils for each other right

415
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
foil is

416
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,333
not necessarily a character who is

417
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,566
the opposite of another character 

418
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:05,000
but it's someone whose qualities like

419
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,533
when we see how structured and mannered

420
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:12,230
and let's say by the book that Kim is 

421
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,266
 we see him express those qualities

422
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,200
it creates a major contrast

423
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,766
with our own character

424
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,933
and amplifies our awareness of these qualities

425
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,966
like if you put two people who are like Kim next to each other 

426
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,012
we don't necessarily notice

427
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:33,800
how important these things are 

428
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,333
for keeping his whole worldview intact

429
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,366
but the second you put him next to the detective

430
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,386
or someone like * Cuno

431
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,766
that's where the contrast really comes through

432
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,566
and we start to see where those compromises happen 

433
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,100
because at least in my play through

434
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,166
I got Kim to try to shoot down the body right

435
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:57,766
this is not something that fits with this worldview that we 

436
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,400
normally might associate with him with

437
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:07,000
I think somewhere in the mix we got to see what it was like

438
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,100
when Kim wasn't able to stifle the competition between

439
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:16,366
some of his own more pressing mental states 

440
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:19,933
and right down here this mental state lost to

441
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:24,800
any number of these that sort of represent pride

442
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,600
and that's what makes them as a dynamic

443
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,066
no matter what kind of play through I imagine you're having 

444
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,766
so fun and so unique to watch is because like

445
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
you are the character

446
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,000
who is not really trying to stop these 

447
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:41,600
mental states from having fierce competition

448
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,700
and you are literally just letting whichever one is strongest  drive view

449
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,500
especially because as the player

450
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,900
like you want to explore and exhaust as many

451
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,933
options as you can to get the best outcome

452
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:57,400
like in trying to play optimally as a character

453
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,800
we end up allowing our

454
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,666
character that we're playing to be totally

455
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,566
disregulated and unpredictable

456
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,425
we can't play as someone necessarily like Kim

457
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,800
and get the most optimal result 

458
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:14,966
because it very rarely takes sort of like 

459
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
allowing this competition between the mental states to

460
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,366
resolve itself in a neat and structured and orderly way 

461
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,733
so that's one of the

462
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,900
ideas that I was having as I was playing through

463
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:31,933
just like the first couple hours of disco elysium

464
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:36,666
like I said this is something that is not super easy to explain to people 

465
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,400
in clinical practice sometimes

466
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,066
other than to say that like

467
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,533
first we're gonna try to demonstrate that motivation is not  really 

468
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,666
it's not sufficient enough of an idea to explain

469
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:51,166
why behaviors that we don't want continue

470
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,800
if this is like my 20th time trying to get sober and I'm still relapsing 

471
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,900
it's something that her(his) main character is probably still dealing with 

472
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,100
like he doesn't want to have headaches

473
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,800
he doesn't want to feel like he hates himself

474
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:07,400
he doesn't want to be confused about who he is 

475
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,966
or maybe he does

476
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:11,666
right I guess we're gonna find out but

477
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,066
if we assume good intentions

478
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,066
if we even just assume that getting what he wants

479
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:22,533
even if it's like really simple and primal the things that he wants 

480
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,566
if that requires being in

481
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:29,266
good health and having good perception reaction speed

482
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:32,300
in you know having a healthy physical instrument

483
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
a healthy body

484
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:35,933
if that requires it then you

485
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,733
you should be invested in

486
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,733
you know not killing yourself

487
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,133
moment to moment by like

488
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,766
desperately hounding everyone you see for a pack of sigis right 

489
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,200
but that's what he does anyways

490
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,566
that's what my character is doing

491
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,666
because this is not as simple as well

492
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,200
if you just want it bad enough

493
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,766
you would work harder on it

494
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,933
I think that that's the big myth in any sort of mental health 

495
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:02,200
it's like if you just wanted to be happy enough

496
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,100
you just you would find a way to do it

497
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:07,366
it's not that simple right

498
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:11,200
that is a very one dimensional way of thinking about things 

499
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,766
wanting something is not enough 

500
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,800
to resolve the inner sort of turmoil that happens when

501
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,866
you have different priority structures all vying for

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,800
your attention and for your decision making power

503
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,266
so that brings me to like

504
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,666
this is a problem

505
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,700
how do you actually work on it 

506
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,500
what would I do with

507
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:36,700
let's say myself the detective or someone like Kim

508
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,733
maybe even more appropriately because

509
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:43,966
feel like he just is more ready to be in therapy than the detective 

510
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,466
I think that guy needs like serious detoxing before

511
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:51,600
like any level of talk therapy would even be effective with him 

512
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:55,900
but one of the approaches that I find very useful

513
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,700
in working on situations like this

514
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,800
is an approach called internal family systems it's also called IFS 

515
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,733
so internal family systems is a type of therapy in which 

516
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,750
the framework you're using is that

517
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,766
we consider the inner parts of ourselves to be like

518
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:18,333
a close family of individuals right and so 

519
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:22,600
we would use the terminology of parts to describe

520
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,450
a part of you that's angry

521
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,500
 a part of you that wants to still use a part of you that wants to be sober

522
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,450
a part of you that wants to smack Cuno in the face

523
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,333
and a part of you that wants to give him

524
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,000
a healthy home to return to right

525
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:45,666
like there are disparate parts of ourselves that in

526
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,900
the same way that I was talking about here

527
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,573
may not always agree with each other and

528
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:57,166
so the goal of IFS therapy is to learn how to like

529
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,100
develop lines of communication between these things

530
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
and so now I would imagine like the character

531
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,466
saying something like well

532
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:04,666
you know

533
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,533
that part of me

534
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:10,600
feels like it's never quite in control right there's a

535
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,866
there's a sense of authority that's missing right

536
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:16,200
the the part of me that's angry struggles the most with authority 

537
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,900
and you could attach those two

538
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,733
you know ideas to each other

539
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,400
you could say okay well what about the part of you that

540
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,400
can sort of understand

541
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,825
where Cuno is coming from and that

542
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:32,499
 his expression of vulgarity is his way of 

543
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:36,200
like controlling his own competing mental states

544
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:40,266
and you may be able to connect that part of yourself with 

545
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,933
you know a source of empathy

546
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,300
and so we might actually engage in that

547
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,733
process by saying like okay well

548
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,900
what would a conversation

549
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,733
between these two parts look like

550
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,866
where do you think there is some common ground

551
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,666
between these two parts that that don't agree right

552
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:58,400
so IFS is something I can imagine being pretty useful here 

553
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:01,400
it's not something I'm super specialized in

554
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:08,375
but I do find the framework of discussing the self as different parts  

555
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:12,700
 that actually all have the potential to want the same thing

556
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,533
and sort of

557
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:17,175
being the pursuit of like finding what that thing is

558
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:22,566
and working to make this a common shared goal within yourself 

559
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:26,066
and so it's something that I think could really benefit

560
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
these two gentlemen in particular

561
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,966
so that's a little bit of a breakdown on

562
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,133
kind of my thoughts so far on

563
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,500
one of the very interesting ways that Disco Elysium portrays mental health 

564
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,675
I genuinely think that like the way

565
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:42,825
it has integrated these ideas as a

566
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:46,333
like narrative dialogue skill system is

567
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,500
absolutely ingenious and

568
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:52,766
really gives us like a framework for discussing something that 

569
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,933
is not always easy to grasp by the person

570
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,900
who isn't necessarily sure about why 

571
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,800
they feel like they're being pulled in these different directions

572
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,300
and like I said

573
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,166
this is a subject that is relevant to not just addiction 

574
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:08,050
but is relevant to depression any kind of mental illness  

575
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,900
or even just like a normal healthy person who

576
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:15,533
can have competition between two mental states

577
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,400
one that tells you it's time to get up for work

578
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
and the other that's like actually go back to bed 

579
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:25,400
I have that competition every single day of my life

580
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,100
and boy is it a struggle

581
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:31,333
so I hope you enjoyed this little vignette analysis

582
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:31,766
like I said

583
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:34,166
I think this would be a cool way to sort of engage

584
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,966
with people who may not be able to commit to

585
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,750
watching all of the let's plays either live or in the vods 

586
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,600
because you know they can be quite long uploads after all 

587
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,600
so let me know what you think about this format

588
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
if you enjoyed it

589
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,466
it's great to see so many new people

590
00:26:49,466 --> 00:26:50,700
kind of join in the community

591
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,300
and getting interested in this stuff

592
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm really happy to have you here

593
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,100
and I'm excited to do more of this kind of thing

594
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:56,725
very soon

595
00:26:56,725 --> 00:27:00,066
so that said next episode is coming

596
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:02,400
shortly after this one and

597
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,500
we'll see you there bye

598
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:11,866
do you have any competing mental state

599
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,916
that you want to share with the class

600
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:17,103
no

601
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,366
she's perfect as she is

602
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:20,933
bye
