00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:01,066
hello

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,100
and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,833
in my therapist plays disco elysium analysis serie

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,233
so this time I wanted to share something

5
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:12,266
that I learned about particular character in the game and

6
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:15,666
also some things that I learned about myself

7
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,133
in the course of uploading this series

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,900
so just for context if you're just come into this now

9
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,366
the way I'm kind of playing through the game

10
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:27,200
is from like the perspective of being a therapist

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,400
and trying to provide as much commentary as I can on

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,533
different angles of mental health that are depicted in the game

13
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,166
there's a lot more going on than just that at the disco elysium

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,833
but I'm really just I'm not the person

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,500
to comment on like complicated political stuff

16
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,966
and one of the most important dynamics in the game

17
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:49,200
is the one that you have with your partner Kim Kitsuragi

18
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,200
and I recognize that like as the player

19
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,900
we're going to be a lot more aware of

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,166
Kim's qualities than my character the detective well

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,900
and so in my role play of him

22
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:04,166
I've sort of been exploring the subject of

23
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,933
someone who is coming from a background of trauma

24
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,500
which we still don't know a lot

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,300
about Raphael from where I'm at in the game

26
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:21,300
but a lot of his issues with the way he views authority and relationships

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,000
and his struggles with substance abuse

28
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,033
kind of indicate that

29
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,066
there may be some of that background present

30
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,433
so I've been kind of approaching a lot of the dialogue

31
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,800
with Kim from this perspective

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,200
that like we tend to have an initial first impression about someone

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,100
that we may want to trust them

34
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,200
but if we're someone who has a lot of trust issues

35
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,500
we may sort of like test that relationship over time

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,333
we may kind of see where the real boundaries are

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,766
and from my character's perspective

38
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,666
he's kind of been trying to see like this

39
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,366
this Kim's sticking around with me

40
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:57,366
because he needs me to complete this case

41
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:01,133
or are the qualities that we immediately picked up on that

42
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,166
he is earnest and trustworthy

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,433
and a very honest character at hearts

44
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:09,900
are those things going to last

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,733
when we make ourselves very difficult to be around basically

46
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,933
I'm definitely going to ask him

47
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,566
I really want to impress him

48
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,033
and I want him to think that I'm cool

49
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,500
and that I'm not a fucking ass

50
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,833
I've been kind of trying to demonstrate that

51
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,633
like some of the closest relationships you can have

52
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:28,433
are ones that have really been put through that test

53
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:31,233
and have outlasted that period of

54
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:35,066
like if I push this person far enough

55
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,133
are they still gonna stick with me

56
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:41,533
a sigh the lieutenant buries his nose in his notebook

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,066
see there's another thing that that I'm not sure about Kim

58
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,000
the way that she spoke to me just now

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,800
she's giving an honest reflection

60
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:55,200
and she's empathizing with me

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,366
whereas Kim is showing me disappointment

62
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,700
and he's showing me mistrust

63
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,300
like maybe I am too brain damaged

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,433
to be useful to him

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,400
and so as Brady the player

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,866
I can see that um you know these are genuine qualities in Kim

67
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:10,700
but from the perspective of my character

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,166
there's still some distance there

69
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,166
and still some things

70
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,433
that we're trying to kind of put through that test

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,833
so that's been kind of one of my goals with the play through

72
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,833
but in the last episode

73
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:25,800
we had one of our first like real one on one exchanges with Kim

74
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,700
and in that conversation

75
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,733
I was actually hoping to like

76
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,300
instigate some tension between these two characters

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,966
to sort of like kind of push that conversation about

78
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,866
like what does it look like to push through

79
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,266
you know a barrier of trust between two people

80
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,066
and I was doing so by trying to

81
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:45,933
also use an approach that is sometimes useful in therapy

82
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:51,066
for kind of like getting someone to talk more openly about

83
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,933
subjects that may be uncomfortable to them

84
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,833
as kind of a way to like

85
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,533
push the boundaries of our relationship with Kim

86
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:04,600
to a point where we are openly challenging some of the ideas

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,833
that may present tension between us

88
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:09,366
and actually start to work through them

89
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,666
and build some of that trust between us

90
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,266
so this is kind of what that looks like

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,966
the idea here is that

92
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,700
we often try to deal with our emotions

93
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,100
in a very sort of like intellectual way

94
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,533
meaning that we're talking about them

95
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:28,266
but the emotions that are attached to a difficult subject

96
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,733
are not present with us

97
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,200
we're discussing something like that

98
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,800
we went through a breakup or something

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,366
 but we're sort of giving more of like

100
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:37,566
a historical analytical account of it

101
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:40,500
more so than getting in touch with the emotions

102
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,400
that might actually be present there

103
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,766
and the reason that we intellectualize things is

104
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:47,066
because it keeps our anxiety low

105
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:47,733
right

106
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm talking about something

107
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,400
and I'm sort of trying to avoid really

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
the uncomfortable feelings that might be present there

109
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,366
and yet some of the best processing work that we can do 

110
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,700
is going to take place in this like zone

111
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,066
where the psychological work actually happens

112
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,100
when there's a little bit of that anxiety present right

113
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,400
when we sort of break through the like layers and layers

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,600
of defense mechanisms and avoidance

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,100
that we're having to not actually get in touch

116
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,933
with those uncomfortable feelings

117
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:22,300
if I see someone intellectualizing

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,900
I might try to you know push a little bit into that subject

119
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,200
kind of try to raise the anxiety a little bit

120
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:33,266
and it's very common for people to kind of retreat back into intellectualizing

121
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,166
and sort of avoid that

122
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,033
and so you may need to push a little harder right

123
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:41,533
and you're trying to get that person to a point where

124
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,566
they are feeling enough of the emotion to talk about it

125
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:48,933
without going too far right

126
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:52,400
and then we end up sort of in a crisis situation

127
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,166
It's a tricky thing to manage

128
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:58,600
and this is kind of what I was trying to show in the dialogue with Kim

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,466
but it was in the pursuit of trying to demonstrate this

130
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:04,766
and kind of analyze the dynamics I play

131
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,966
that I sort of get things very wrong about Kim

132
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:11,333
and really what the whole conversation we were having was actually about

133
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,733
the conversation that we were having was about Kim's cultural heritage

134
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,266
and he's explaining to me that

135
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,533
he has no attachments to Seol

136
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,133
he calls himself a regular garden variety Revacholiere

137
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,433
and it's pretty evident that this conversation makes him feel uncomfortable

138
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,133
Kim is tired of people assuming that

139
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:35,566
he has some sort of connection to his Seolite ancestry

140
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,366
when really that's never been a part of his history

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,666
and it's frustratingly common for him

142
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,500
to feel like people don't consider him a genuine Revacholiere

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,133
because he doesn't necessarily look like the other people in the country

144
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,266
and so while we were in this dialogue

145
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:58,333
I was sort of looking for ways to raise the tensions

146
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,866
so that I could sort of like talk about

147
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,566
what this dynamic can look like

148
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:06,166
when someone really gets in touch with an uncomfortable emotion

149
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,866
but I got the wrong read on why he was becoming uncomfortable

150
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,700
and some of the assumptions

151
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,366
that not just from my character's point of view

152
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,000
but also in my own thinking

153
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,333
had some prejudices

154
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:19,566
and at the time

155
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:25,166
a lot of my focus was on just trying to sort of like increase the tensions

156
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,866
so that I could you know talk about this therapeutic technique

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,366
but I think that's really where the problem actually starts for me

158
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,866
which is that I wasn't thinking as much about how

159
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,333
people who relate to Kim in real life

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,200
feel when questions like this come up

161
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:44,333
and so I carried on with that conversation and continued the play through

162
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,566
and then it was after I published that episode

163
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,933
that I started to get a lot of comments that pointed this out to me

164
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:53,266
people share their perspectives of how they relate to Kim 

165
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,866
and how it is very common for people to assume

166
00:07:56,866 --> 00:08:02,666
 that they must have an inherent attachment to their heritage's culture

167
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,866
and that they must feel conflicted about this

168
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,300
which is kind of you know where

169
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,800
my line of questioning towards Kim was coming from

170
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,500
It may come from a place of genuine curiosity

171
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:17,100
but there are prejudices inlaid in that assumption that go overlooked

172
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,233
and so I'm sorry to anyone for whom this

173
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,833
brought up these kinds of hurtful feelings

174
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,033
and uh even though it wasn't intentional

175
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,666
I know that I'm responsible for

176
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,433
what I say and for the way it makes other people feel

177
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,033
I am so appreciative of this community

178
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,533
and for the people who shared their experiences

179
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,633
in the commons of that video

180
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:43,033
because it was done in such a respectful and truly informative way

181
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,333
this was something that I needed some education on

182
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,933
and so I'm also very thankful for that as well

183
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,600
the other part that I wanted to talk about in this video

184
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:59,800
is actually just how I reflected on this whole situation

185
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,900
and kind of discovered some things

186
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,600
that actually make me uncomfortable about myself

187
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,533
so after I published the video

188
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,900
I started to get some comments

189
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,266
that were you know strongly disagreeing with everything

190
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:11,933
and I had to say about Kim

191
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,833
and they were right about every single one

192
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,100
but looking back on it now I can see that

193
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,166
like some of my first replies were rather defensive

194
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:23,866
and that's just the honest truth

195
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:29,100
I thought that I was being criticized for having a misunderstanding

196
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,366
and that this would be sort of mistaken for genuine bigotry

197
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,400
and so my first couple of replies were sort of focused on

198
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,833
like trying to explained that I didn't mean that

199
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,733
and you know I was not going at it from that angle

200
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,633
and here's what I really meant to talk about

201
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,833
and I just it wasn't the right way to go about that either

202
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,766
I shouldn't have been trying to like explain that I meant no offence

203
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,591
and really just should have started listening and 

204
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:58,566
accepting what people had to say

205
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,400
so I was being defensive and like I hate this about myself

206
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:07,100
like I don't like that's my first reaction to being uncomfortable

207
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,500
which is really

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,933
it's kind of exactly what I'm demonstrating in my whole little chart here

209
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:18,666
like honestly

210
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,566
it's it's kind of amusing I guess

211
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:25,033
to see that like what I experience

212
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,200
is a better demonstration of this principle

213
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,666
than whatever I was trying to say in the video

214
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,033
and just totally blew it 

215
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,466
here I am

216
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,800
like trying to come at a very intellectual angle with

217
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
like no I didn't mean that here's what I really meant

218
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,033
I was actually trying to explain this thing

219
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,233
no like what I was doing is avoiding my own anxiety you know

220
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:50,466
and the more that people started to comment

221
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,033
and share their experiences

222
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:55,200
and I just kind of realized

223
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,966
not only was my take on like Kim's character just totally wrong

224
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:03,900
but it was also upsetting and hurtful to people who relate to him

225
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,266
and have to deal with similar things all the time

226
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,266
I never wanted to like confront people's real issues that way

227
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,566
but like I said intention or not like that's what happens

228
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:20,300
and realizing that like my mistake could have upset someone to that degree

229
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,033
like my anxiety started going up like a lot

230
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,633
and um I was going to stream that evening and I decided not to

231
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:34,433
because like I was just I was probably a little bit higher up here

232
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:38,333
like I really felt this just wouldn't be a good idea you know

233
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,500
I I'm not feeling good about myself

234
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,333
and I um have some like self reflection to do here

235
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,733
and it was actually when

236
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,066
I went back and started to read some of the comments

237
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,300
and reread them

238
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,000
and realized that

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,033
like no one there was attacking me

240
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,566
like they were just sharing their experiences

241
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,100
trying to inform me

242
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,833
that my anxiety started to come down

243
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:13,700
and legitimately it's there that I started to think a lot more clearly

244
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,766
on why I actually had that reaction to begin with

245
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:22,933
so I realized that I not only need to apologize for you know what was said

246
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:26,400
but I also just needed to reflect a lot on myself here

247
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,666
I needed to see that the reason I became so defensive

248
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,366
at first and then anxious after that

249
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:37,112
was that I actually do have some

250
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:40,400
 biases and prejudices and assumptions

251
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,233
that II didn't even know I had right

252
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:49,433
and it was only after being sort of like very uncomfortably confronted by that

253
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,000
did I start to detect

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,866
like okay this this avoidance you're having

255
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:57,166
is because there are some misinformed

256
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,333
and overlooked assumptions that you have

257
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,333
that make you feel uncomfortable

258
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,633
and you don't like realizing that

259
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:08,300
you know not every thought that crosses your mind

260
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,266
is gonna be formed in absolute perfection before you say it

261
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,733
and that scares me

262
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:19,466
but it's also like just natural

263
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,133
and you know I'm trying to learn as much as I can from this experience

264
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,866
and I understand that even some of

265
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,933
what I'm doing right here is a little bit of intellectualizing

266
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,166
but like what is true and honest is that the other day

267
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,933
I felt like just really beside myself with disappointment

268
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,433
but that's okay you know

269
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:41,133
it it's okay to feel that way sometimes

270
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,666
because what it has brought to me

271
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,866
is you know a little bit more awareness

272
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:50,900
and um helped me just see a little bit more

273
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,000
where people were coming from

274
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,233
for that I'm also sorry

275
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,800
but I'm also very thankful to those of you

276
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,000
who helped me learn something new about myself and

277
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,333
just reminding me that you know there's

278
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:08,033
there's definitely some areas that I have to do some work on too

279
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:12,300
you know this whole process is not something I'm unfamiliar with

280
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,233
and it's really why I want to bring it up in the first place

281
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,500
because I do really believe that  

282
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,633
there's some things that are a little too below the surface

283
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,466
that you don't even really know they are there

284
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,300
and it takes a certain kind of confrontation to actually

285
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,433
put them in front of you

286
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,833
and like make you a little uncomfortable

287
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,933
like oh wow I didn't even really know

288
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,766
that I had that kind of assumption

289
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,633
like that makes me really uncomfortable

290
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:45,233
so like what do I need to do to start working on it

291
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,833
and like I know how to manage that

292
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,100
when it comes to like doing therapy with someone else

293
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,766
and how to sort of like safely bring them to that point

294
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,300
and you know make sure that like we're developing inside around this

295
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,166
and not going down a path of like major self criticism

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
which is something I tend to do

297
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,100
but it's just it's really hard to do sometimes

298
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,900
when it's yourself and uh it's your own issues that need attention

299
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:16,300
so that's just something that I really wanted to say about all of this

300
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,466
and um you know the fact that a game like Disco Elycium exists

301
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:26,133
and has so many complicated layers to it

302
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,366
and can be the cause of the genuine self discovery

303
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,033
good and bad

304
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,033
just continues to amaze me and makes me you know

305
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,566
even more excited too keep playing it

306
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,575
so my understanding of Kim 

307
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:42,400
has definitely changed as a result of this

308
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,266
but that's like speaking for myself

309
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,266
for my character

310
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:52,333
 you know I do think that there is something worth exploring

311
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:57,566
on the subject of like the two of them not immediately starting to get along

312
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,733
I do expect that between my detective and Kim

313
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:04,233
there are still some things to sort of work on

314
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,766
and that you know it's still going to take some time before

315
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,066
we warm up to each other

316
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,633
so for the sake of the role play

317
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:14,100
you know there may still be times where we confront each other

318
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,566
but I will definitely be in a better perspective with myself

319
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,800
as we explore those subjects and talk about them

320
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,833
you know that's been one of the most interesting parts

321
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,500
of the play through so far

322
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,066
is just how much discussion this stimulates 

323
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:31,866
including this one

324
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,033
so I'm really curious to see where we go from

325
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:39,000
so thank you again for everyone who shared their perspective with me

326
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:46,000
I just appreciate the way that everyone is engaging with this series

327
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:52,366
it's been more impactful to me than I think I'm even really able to show here

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,666
and look I know that I'm also just like generally trashed at playing the game

329
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,900
like our play through is a total mess

330
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,566
I'm missing all kinds of important things

331
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:05,733
and um you know that's something that I'll uh try to work on as well

332
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,366
so with that said

333
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,733
I'll see you all on the next one Goodbye
