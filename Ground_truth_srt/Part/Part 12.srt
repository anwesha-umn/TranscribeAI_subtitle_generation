1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:01,250
hello 

2
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:05,225
and welcome to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series 

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,125
on today's episode we are meeting what has become 

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:12,116
another one of my absolute favorite characters that we've met so far 

5
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,425
so we're gonna be talking a lot with Annette and her mother today 

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,925
learning more about the economic reality 

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,675
of being a child who has to work out in the cold all day 

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,400
and in that dialogue we're also gonna be continuing to build our own character profile

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:33,750
sort of continuing the analysis using the JaharI window that we started in the last episode 

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:38,750
there's a lot of emotions to dig into and discuss in today's episode 

11
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,684
including some that may come up when we finally face ourselves

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,100
so that's where we're at I'm excited to continue so

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,425
let's jump back in

14
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:48,925
okay

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,366
what shall we do next

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,017
I guess we can go enter the green the door behind the greenhouse

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,133
let's go do that

18
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,200
it's in the yard basement door is that back there

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,411
yeah it's more useful in counseling

20
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,075
what's this girl up to it's been a while since we've checked in

21
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:36,275
every snowflake is like a little gift from the sky

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
she is way too positive

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
oh it's snowing

24
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:48,600
what is this crime business

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,450
crime fiction is about murders or burglaries or things like that 

26
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,533
and the work of a policeman or a private detective

27
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,675
who's trying to solve a crime and catch the criminals

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,966
I need to know what *crime* is

29
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,350
it's that bad (point to your head)

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,175
crime is what we were solving before this conversation began 

31
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,300
why would anyone want to *read* about crime

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,450
it's exciting to people I guess

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,966
they get to imagine dangerous things

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,025
and it's kind of like a puzzle where you can guess who the criminal is 

35
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,300
or how the good guys are going to catch him

36
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,875
i'm a policeman myself by the way

37
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,900
you don't look much like a policeman 

38
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,933
I know

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,075
well what does a cop look like then

40
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,600
didn't mean to offend sir sorry sir 

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,300
it's just that you don't look like Dick Mullen

42
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,875
she points to a book cover on which you can see strapping Vespertine officer 

43
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,166
he stands grimly over the body of a dead woman

44
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,533
you know nobody actually looks like the guy in the picture

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
it's not your body that's important in police work

46
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,266
it's your head

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,775
emm

48
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,725
i'll never be as good as him that's probably pretty accurate yeah 

49
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:12,475
don't say that he's not even real you're real

50
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,066
am I

51
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,625
okay that's getting heavily existential Annette

52
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,375
and that's what I mean I'm gonna put that on the board 

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,625
I'm gonna fucking put that on the board

54
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:40,500
that's my blind spot we're we're real

55
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:49,225
someone else sees this that that we don't get right

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
and this is part of identity

57
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,250
it does right what does this statement 

58
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,850
like what does it mean for a statement like that 

59
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,541
to suddenly become real to you as well like when you 

60
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,075
because my character is like well I'll never be that good 

61
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:15,350
i'll never be the ideal policeman 

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,625
and she's like well that doesn't matter you're fine as you are 

63
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,175
like don't try to live up to that 

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,533
I think what 

65
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,600
what's behind we are real is really like

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,100
and not everyone hates us 

67
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,325
that is very often in our blind spot 

68
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,566
hell it's often in my blind spot right 

69
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:49,325
we tend to develop ideas that people hate us and

70
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,241
that everyone sees how fucked up our life is just like we do 

71
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:57,400
 but they don't right

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,875
part of my shame makes it impossible for me to see this sometimes 

73
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,258
from the character's point of view 

74
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:09,625
so like to learn about that 

75
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,550
again makes me feel like I have to let this drive less of this 

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,745
trying to use authority to to get people to listen to me  

77
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:25,075
and that fits with what I just said right because like 

78
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,975
what we're saying is I'll never be as good as him meaning 

79
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:32,750
people will never respect me like they do this cop 

80
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,181
like I'm not a good cop 

81
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:39,400
it all comes back down to like is this true for me 

82
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,800
maybe Annette just fucking gave us some little bit of therapy

83
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:55,042
made us a little more comfortable with our identity

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,300
yeah

85
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,433
and

86
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,133
maybe moved goodcop a little bit up into the blind spot like

87
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,700
something someone else sees that you know we're not understanding 

88
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,533
so maybe we're gonna see a little bit of that motion

89
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:21,983
right

90
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,775
that's right a real failure 

91
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:32,800
well it would be it would be pretty 

92
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:36,500
oh yeah that's right Seachelle you're right 

93
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,133
Lena and Annette  

94
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,400
I forgot that the other character's name wasn't it

95
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,300
that's right a real failure yeah

96
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,275
that's how we feel

97
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,933
cheer up sir no need to compare yourself to a fictional character 

98
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,666
it's too real it's too fucking real

99
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:04,575
maybe you can show me some *real* deductive police work sir  

100
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,250
like in the books

101
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:14,000
okay I want to do that let's see  

102
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,800
what is romance

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,933
it's a type of book where there's a rich lady

104
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,425
and she has to choose between the good man and the bad man

105
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,450
she imagines herself in that situation

106
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,375
or that could be a story about a poor lady getting a rich man 

107
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,625
it's about man and lady business sir 

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,475
what about

109
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,375
a book where the man and lady business doesn't work out

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
that feels pretty

111
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,075
that's on our mind right now

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,375
I haven't read many of those maybe should ask Mum

113
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,750
you think she has one about an *excruciatingly painful* breakup

114
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,425
I don't think it's a romance story if the main characters break up though 

115
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:56,800
it can be

116
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,000
think about it one where they plunge into a torrid spiral of pain and recrimination  

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,900
recrimination

118
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,932
only it's *really long* and drawn out

119
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,825
scarred for life phantom limb

120
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:16,366
ummm no I don't know

121
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,875
she's she's giving me Fritter girl vibes with um I don't know  

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,600
you can take this blossom like a pain-flower

123
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,425
and it drags on for years and years with no resolution inside holy shit 

124
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:34,060
the girl is at a loss for words

125
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,575
each of you filling with resentment and bitterness 

126
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,370
for having *ruined* each other's lives

127
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:40,800
this poor girl

128
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,500
she shifts and sways on her feet

129
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,150
looking confused and uncomfortable 

130
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,775
somehow this young girl has been totally like insulated  

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,600
from whatever fucked up things

132
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,166
have influenced all the other kids in this world

133
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,550
and I am very curious about why 

134
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,051
stop there's no need for this 

135
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,366
it's in your power to change the subject

136
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,400
so I find what Volition does to us very interesting

137
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,900
so far volition

138
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,150
it's almost like the different voices have different tactics  

139
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,500
for how to work on these problems right

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,250
like Volition wants us to not move anything out of this box

141
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,133
it wants us to

142
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,125
not enter this space because it is too painful right

143
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,166
there's so many scary things in the unknown right now

144
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,750
that it maybe doesn't feel like we're ready to face

145
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,175
or doesn't think are worthwhile to face

146
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,549
it's in our best interest that it doesn't want us to be heard of course 

147
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,750
but I don't think that that's the goal

148
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:05,100
we actually do want to move things that way

149
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,075
Annette isn't really the appropriate person 

150
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,366
hey Seachelle that's never stopped me before 

151
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,725
on second thought this seems like an inappropriate topic to discuss with children 

152
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,400
it's gonna hurt me if I don't stop isn't it

153
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,966
I think we've gone far enough with this one

154
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:31,025
this is a little too intense

155
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:35,566
poor girl

156
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,600
um what about when everyone is poor

157
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,975
that's really not a proper romance story

158
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,166
that's more like everyday life

159
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:55,880
god damn okay so she is aware of reality as well 

160
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,300
 the economic reality as Frittte girl would say

161
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:04,000
I bet she I bet she's had her own little chapter of wandering into Frittte and

162
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:09,466
getting a bit of a lowdown on the economic reality from

163
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:11,900
from best girl

164
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,850
sometimes you gotta real right about real life things

165
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,700
not in romance books sir

166
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
these are about nice and pretty people

167
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,766
and everyone is happy in the end

168
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,825
what about when both of the men are bad

169
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,250
these are not very common

170
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,825
you can't have a choice between bad and bad

171
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,879
nobody wants to read a story like that 

172
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:31,733
true

173
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,533
what if it's written really well

174
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,733
well maybe then it's fine

175
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:39,350
maybe if the lady then decides not to pick either 

176
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,000
because she doesn't need a bad man 

177
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,975
yes that would be interesting  

178
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,400
what about a poor man getting a rich lady 

179
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,250
it happens

180
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:49,975
but usually the guy gets rich in the process or should actually be rich himself 

181
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,475
but has lost his family property unjustly

182
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,425
like during the revolution or something 

183
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:55,166
I see

184
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,600
those are unhappy books for most of the pages

185
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,125
people sad about what they have lost

186
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:02,400
but then it all turns out just fine in the end

187
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,225
just like I'm sure this story will 

188
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,800
that's enough romance for me

189
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,275
maybe some about other books 

190
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,933
yes let's ask about famous people 

191
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,925
kings and queens and generals of old  

192
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,650
or artists and writers or musicians

193
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,166
those kinds of people

194
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,725
there's usually something extraordinary about them

195
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,325
I discovered you through your disco playthrough

196
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,350
and just want to let you know your video and volition

197
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,600
helped me not spiral into my destructive habits

198
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,325
after I slept in past an appointment today

199
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,725
hey that's that I appreciate that  

200
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,200
I am always enthusiastically surprised when

201
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,400
people actually see those patterns in their real life

202
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:44,650
and do something about it

203
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
that's awesome thank you for sharing

204
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,675
I think that's why people read them to find the secrets of their fame 

205
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,600
can I be famous

206
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I don't know about that

207
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:58,000
but I imagine life is great when you're famous 

208
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,204
they're all dorks

209
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:06,775
they sound like dorks 

210
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:07,925
fame sounds delicious 

211
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:11,225
maybe someday someone will write a book about me one day well 

212
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,050
we're not too happy about ourselves right now

213
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:20,550
let's yeah let's this is called a sour grapes

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,650
it's coping skill or not coping skill

215
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,975
defense mechanism eco defense mechanism 

216
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,000
it comes from the asap fable I think it is  

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,300
where the fox is in the forest

218
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,666
and he sees some grapes that he wants

219
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,050
but there is a thorn bush between him and the grapes

220
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,175
and he can't get them and so he convinces himself that  

221
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:48,191
I didn't want those grapes anyways 

222
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:52,400
sort of like

223
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,825
the famous people suck anyways why would I want to be them  

224
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:01,375
and its expression remains ever so helpful  

225
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,999
but she doesn't say anything

226
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,575
never mind I literally had nothing else to say 

227
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,400
okay

228
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,850
okay let's do some detective work for Annette

229
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:16,950
okay guys throw me some of your best lucky tomatoes okay  

230
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:23,175
look we have not done very many good things in this playthrough yet  

231
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,354
we're trying we're becoming a sorry cop 

232
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,200
we're making up for our past 

233
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,533
we're trying to solve the murder

234
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,800
but and we're making up with Cuno

235
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,700
we're gonna find lena's husband

236
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,333
we're gonna do it all okay we're gonna do all the good things 

237
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,700
one of the most important things we can do right now though  

238
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,025
is like make Annette smile

239
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,350
she's had a long day standing out here in the cold

240
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,575
thinking about the economic reality that she's in  

241
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,000
and transporting herself to fictional worlds

242
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,176
where the outcome is always good

243
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,568
because that's the only way to escape from real life

244
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,850
where the outcome is always bad all right  

245
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,625
she loves cops she loves crime 

246
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,600
she loves the mythological archetype of human experience that it represents  

247
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,533
detection 

248
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,300
uncovering secrets 

249
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:19,525
finding resolution

250
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,445
making the world right again

251
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,125
providing structure where there is chaos okay

252
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,150
she's a philosopher she's a queen

253
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,926
all we have to do is make her smile

254
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,550
all we have to do is validate that 

255
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,566
her time spends enjoying the fictional reality 

256
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:46,014
means that the emotion she has in reality are 

257
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:48,248
just as real as those ones in those books 

258
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:49,166
let's do it

259
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,266
let's roll the dice

260
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,733
let's roll the fuckin dice baby

261
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:57,866
you fail to deduce anything substantial

262
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:05,500
fuck

263
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,675
god damn it

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,500
i'm sorry Annette I'm sorry I'm a sorry cop

265
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,300
I'm so sorry

266
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:26,733
I'm such a broken man I have I can't even 

267
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,550
I can't even use my detective work to 

268
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,350
brighten up this poor girl's life for a moment

269
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,400
she waits intensely

270
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,525
I actually I can't deduce anything 

271
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,075
no I can't look I 

272
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,666
and that's whole structure for viewing the world

273
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,600
is that there's good cops out there

274
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:55,325
maybe that's it 

275
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,930
maybe her entire thing is that the reason she's not so depressed 

276
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,931
is because she sees people like fucking what's his name mullin 

277
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,350
and she sees me and Kim walking around and she's like 

278
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,071
oh well I know the world sucks but like I'm safe because they're here  

279
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:16,175
and they must be good cops and they must be doing good things  

280
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:21,950
and here I am standing in front of her and I can't  I can't I can't even tell her that  

281
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,533
she's

282
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,550
I can't tell her anything interesting

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,025
I can deduce that you are very small 

284
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:41,675
no that's not a good one 

285
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,950
I just I can't deduce anything 

286
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,475
it's okay sir

287
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,291
no it's not

288
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:53,120
a small disappointment rolls over her but she promptly gets over it

289
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,200
it is a massive disappointment for me 

290
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,875
you disappointed a small child well done champ

291
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,400
no

292
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,225
why is this world so cruel to me

293
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,325
do I have any skill points to waste on this

294
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,466
I

295
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
what is it composure

296
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,000
this composure do I have any clothes that I can wear

297
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,600
I have two

298
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:39,275
is it is it worth using a skill point 

299
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,700
yeah I mean it is right it has to be 

300
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,266
I I like 

301
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,800
I cannot let Annette down like this

302
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,850
okay

303
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,975
72 percent

304
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,875
we've got this 

305
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,033
all right lucky tomatoes in the chat 

306
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:08,750
roll the dice

307
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:14,025
we are we are so close to shattering this poor girl's worldview

308
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,125
okay

309
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,675
we have to be the cop that she is dreaming of 

310
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,075
the one that provides structure to the world 

311
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,975
who doesn't just apologize 

312
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,533
but can solve the case of what's going wrong in her little world 

313
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,475
Kim back me up

314
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,975
do I have to uh oh

315
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,375
hello again sir 

316
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,666
okay

317
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,800
do I have any do I have any clothes that give me composure  

318
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,225
conceptualization no no no 

319
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,475
interfacing 

320
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,850
uh

321
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,533
useless it's all a bunch of useless garbage

322
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,694
okay 72 percent chance this is an easy one right

323
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:07,200
I shouldn't say that I should never say that

324
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:10,875
it's always a predictor that it's gonna fail

325
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:16,400
any close lowering my composure that is a good question 

326
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,500
got plus one to composure from the green snake skinned shoes  

327
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,450
and that's gonna find that very impressive

328
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,200
reaction speed is okay

329
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:30,625
okay nothing nothing is interrupting us here 

330
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,775
the faster I click it the faster it goes okay

331
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:41,700
the girl keeps her hands folded hidden why is that 

332
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,325
yes yeah

333
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:46,100
this is this is healing

334
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,525
this is healing time why do you keep your hands folded

335
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:49,825
what do you mean sir

336
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,550
she knows where this is going

337
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,588
you don't need to be worried I'm here to help

338
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:05,166
awww

339
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:12,125
what's what's I think our character genuinely believes that

340
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,052
I think maybe for the one of the first times

341
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:24,966
we can categorically say that this is like our true real intention for someone

342
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,766
because all of the other things

343
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,975
solving the murder we still don't know exactly why we are doing that 

344
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,475
are we doing it to impress Kim are we doing it to make up for something  

345
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,700
are we doing it because we think it is right 

346
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,750
do we even have a grounding on what is right or wrong 

347
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,575
the thing with Cuno we're just so ashamed of what we try to do 

348
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:48,125
that we're trying to reconcile it 

349
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,525
there's so much confusion behind every decision that we've made

350
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:58,075
and this is one of the first times that I feel like we genuinely believe  

351
00:21:58,325 --> 00:21:59,725
this this is real healing

352
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,925
you don't need to be worried I'm here to help

353
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:07,959
she looks around anxiously her hands remain folded in front of her  

354
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:10,375
she doesn't want to show them 

355
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,221
the lieutenant stands by looking at the two of you with little interest 

356
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:20,733
kim mate you are not interested in any of the things

357
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,125
that are directly impacting my healing

358
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,250
a facade of true professionalism

359
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,800
he is far more intrigued by the situation than his poise reveals there 

360
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,608
 there goes my failure to detect kim's stone cold facade

361
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:39,800
you heard me hands up no

362
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,000
it's okay

363
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,575
she brings out her reddened hands 

364
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,774
her nails frayed nearly chewed down to the flesh 

365
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:49,775
oh my god 

366
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,475
you bite your nails

367
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,419
and you knew this for me keeping my hands folded

368
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,450
yes 

369
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,933
well that proves nothing anyone could do an easy deduction like that 

370
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,046
she actually is impressed this is more like a defensive reflex

371
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,000
want more bet I can figure out *why* you bite your nails

372
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:23,765
she nods half provocative half enthusiastic

373
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:29,466
hmm rats have been nibbling on your fingers

374
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:34,533
child labor is dismal in dismal working conditions

375
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,025
you're uptight because of your mother and the pressure she's putting on you 

376
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,350
that seems kind of realistic 

377
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,000
recycling your body material

378
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,125
I don't think so

379
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,650
there's no riches without personal sacrifice hm

380
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,575
this is probably the most realistic one I guess 

381
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,475
maybe so sir okay I know it's a bad habit and I shouldn't 

382
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,775
either way another *ace* detection by the number one detective in town 

383
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,400
I mean she's she's in she's entertained by this right 

384
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,000
it was okay sir

385
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:15,975
more that can be achieved here ask her to do the same

386
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,900
whatever kid I don't need to prove myself to you no that's not us right now  

387
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,500
you think so fine do better to do something about me

388
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:24,750
we're playing around here

389
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,800
you're quite sober

390
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,000
what

391
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,180
that's a very strong observation

392
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:45,162
like like you don't just say that to people right like imagine 

393
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,425
imagine you are meeting your friend in the park or whatever

394
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:54,100
and you walk up to them and they're like hey how's it going   

395
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,828
and you're like oh you're quite sober  

396
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:00,456
like you wouldn't just say that with no context

397
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:05,800
so she can deduce that sobriety is a

398
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,625
limited state for us

399
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,250
yeah there's some implications there

400
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:18,540
what she's probably interacted with us before yeah is a power move 

401
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,525
I wonder what authority is gonna say about that  

402
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:24,525
the lieutenant does not flinch at the comment

403
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:27,875
he does not flinch even a single bit 

404
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,800
he is intensely not flinching it takes out effort 

405
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,133
how do you know I'm usually not 

406
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,725
because you usually aren't 

407
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,866
how would you know

408
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,050
i'm also sad and my head hurts 

409
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,122
i'm sorry sir I hope things get better soon 

410
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,375
gleam of sympathy on her face

411
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:54,878
there she stands swaying on her feet

412
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,206
assaulted by the early spring breeze

413
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:00,100
she smiles at you 

414
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,575
the whole situation suddenly feels familiar somehow  

415
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:07,900
we have definitely interacted with her before

416
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:13,666
so

417
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:22,566
one of the things that I find interesting about this is

418
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:27,600
who is actually moving these things for us right because

419
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:33,125
when our identity was revealed to us 

420
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,600
in a situation where there was manipulation  

421
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:38,900
for example with Evrart Claier

422
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:46,500
there was confusion and anxiety and 

423
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,000
probably more of this and more of this right 

424
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,675
when our identity is revealed to us by someone who is trustworthy 

425
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:59,800
or who we do not feel as manipulative of us like for example 

426
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:06,300
maybe someone who is allowing us to feel more like a good cop like Annette or Lena 

427
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,925
suddenly the disclosure of our past identity 

428
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:14,300
does not bring up so much of these things right 

429
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,925
and I no longer feel the need to 

430
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:23,866
be protective of myself  by being an authoritative person 

431
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:29,375
so this is also showing us what kinds of things that we respond to right 

432
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,375
the kinds of people who are in possession of 

433
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,775
what we don't know about ourselves 

434
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,150
what are you missing here why does this feel familiar 

435
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
please let me succeed 

436
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,275
you have absolutely no idea familiar how  

437
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:45,150
come on 

438
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,700
you must have forgotten something you heard again

439
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,975
seventy two percent 

440
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:53,300
my luck is so all over the fucking place

441
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:00,333
it's easy to forget the Ledger

442
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
yeah I could I'm gonna go back to the ledger at some point

443
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,300
this was on suggestion 

444
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,650
yeah we didn't do any lucky tomatoes it's true 

445
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,966
do I have something that's impacting my suggestion

446
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,166
no

447
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:30,000
I have something that could make it worse oh

448
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,466
and something that could make it better

449
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,050
see if that does anything 

450
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:38,125
hI ace detective are you here for more books  

451
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,366
ah shit

452
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,933
this is essential I need to learn this

453
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,466
yeah let's do it

454
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,300
let's do it we have to know

455
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,666
hI ace detective

456
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:03,300
I am the ace detective 92 percent no tomatoes required  

457
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,133
because you know each other

458
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:07,133
she's been talking to you so openly

459
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:08,350
because you've talked before 

460
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,266
I knew it I knew it 

461
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,375
you know me we've met before 

462
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,800
yes I stand in this spot all the time 

463
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:19,733
you've been running around all week without your shirt on sir

464
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,533
apologizing to everyone

465
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:23,825
don't really understand what you've done wrong

466
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:24,733
that checks out

467
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,450
did I ever talk to you

468
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,966
of course you've stopped by a few times

469
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:32,500
you suddenly look better than the last time I saw you 

470
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:35,450
what do you mean better I look like shit 

471
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,550
yeah but you don't have party eyes anymore 

472
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,366
party eyes yes of course 

473
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,425
that makes sense

474
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:48,675
i'm not surprised children have seen you running around with party eyes on 

475
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,900
he thinks not at all

476
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,525
*party eyes*

477
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:55,650
you know like a cat in the dark or big and wide eyed

478
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:58,425
it certainly looks odd on a man

479
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:01,133
the swiveling eyes of a Looney drug addict

480
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,766
that is what she meant

481
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,650
you were probably good into 

482
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,650
fuck yeah you should get some party eyes right now 

483
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,875
snap those sequins on you boy 

484
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,650
does that mean I've been partaking in narcotics 

485
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,766
oh baby that's not what you have to worry about 

486
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,200
worry about the important thing

487
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:25,200
so why didn't you tell me you knew me to begin with 

488
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:30,525
what are you protecting about me

489
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,666
I didn't know I had to do that

490
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:39,550
hmm thanks I've learned something about myself today

491
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,800
i'm glad I could help you sir

492
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,333
so what have we just seen happen right

493
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,333
something else in our blind spot is

494
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:57,366
there are two things that I just learned here 

495
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,900
actually a couple of things

496
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,625
one of the things that we did not know is how bad we were 

497
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,500
we did not exactly know

498
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:30,200
like we knew that we were destructive and chaotic

499
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,533
and that we had things to apologize for

500
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,725
but the more we learn about this the more we start to understand  

501
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,525
how bad it actually was right  

502
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,625
the fact that a child like Annette

503
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:46,766
someone with a very unique world view in the place that she's in

504
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:52,466
was able to see this and deliver it to us again

505
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:58,400
it very much matters who the person delivering this information to us is  

506
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:06,366
at the same time we're learning how bad we were 

507
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,200
it did not seem to change Annette's perception of us

508
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,950
she's the one who told us we're real  

509
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,066
and this discovery that not everyone hates us

510
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:22,900
even though we were really bad

511
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,200
because down here was like

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,325
this was one of the ideas is that like

513
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:32,700
we were

514
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,050
we are

515
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:41,075
a complete failure

516
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,700
that is one of the central ideas behind that dream sequence right 

517
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
we are a complete failure

518
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,200
billions of people in the world you failed every single one of them

519
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,600
what's fascinating to me is that 

520
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,025
this is something that we suddenly intuitively know about ourselves 

521
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,900
through the dream sequence through the way we just feel   

522
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,000
this is one of those core beliefs that I was talking about 

523
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,725
that we just feel we don't always necessarily have a reason to 

524
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:14,725
like where it came from 

525
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:16,266
sometimes it's maladaptive 

526
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,800
but what just happened 

527
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:23,733
somehow someone told us that this is how bad we were 

528
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:26,700
and it still didn't change their perspective of us 

529
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,780
like it's not like the second Annette saw us she went running 

530
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:36,125
she was not terrified of our real identity 

531
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,600
nor did she think we were a worst cop just because we couldn't remember 

532
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:43,350
and so something very important happening  

533
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:47,700
again this is why I tend to use this in therapy 

534
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,925
is this idea might have just moved this way

535
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,733
and the question

536
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,150
may become something like this right

537
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,075
are we actually a complete failure 

538
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:17,300
and can we through some process of self discovery and healing

539
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:20,300
find a way to see ourselves not as a failure at all 

540
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,733
I think that one of the big things

541
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,450
for people struggling with failure is that we tend to go to the extreme  

542
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:39,200
failure is the experience of losing something so completely that it feels total

543
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:44,300
but something our character may be discovering is that

544
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:48,200
failure is kind of like a gradient right

545
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,700
it is uh

546
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:58,100
not necessarily something that has

547
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,375
only two ways of feeling about it right

548
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:10,550
like failure in this context can very much be 

549
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,366
a gradient between like complete failure and failing in some things  

550
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,466
and so actually

551
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:20,466
this is a good motion for something that we feel like

552
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,933
we intuitively knew about ourselves to suddenly become in question 

553
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:26,766
what does that tell you

554
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:30,333
it tells you that

555
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:39,200
some of your core beliefs may not be as fixed as you might believe 

556
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,300
 if this one may not be totally true

557
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:44,500
maybe some of the others aren't

558
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:47,133
maybe some of my other core beliefs

559
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:49,800
that I am incompatible in a relationship

560
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:53,066
that I am a bad person that I am

561
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,200
untrustworthy manipulatable unable to solve this case right

562
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:05,700
when there is a foundational belief like this that suddenly comes in question 

563
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,066
many of your other foundational beliefs

564
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,100
maybe worth more investigation

565
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,800
and that's something that like we just 

566
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,566
earned through our little dialogue with Annette 

567
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,800
like the children of this game are the real therapists

568
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,166
like she's unpeeled me

569
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,600
I've been unpeeled

570
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:30,166
it unzipped

571
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:41,664
my soft gooey internals have been exposed in this winter hellscape 

572
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,566
 and it makes me feel warm and welcomed

573
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,733
Cuno just wait till we get to Cuno

574
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,733
children will just call out what they see

575
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,533
while adults have ulterior motives totally

576
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,539
you can stop calling me sir I am but a working man

577
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:04,566
 no  sir I can't 

578
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,800
it would be too tiring to refrain from it

579
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:10,100
it's already tiring enough to remember to say it all the time

580
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,200
it's nice if you'd say I could stop though

581
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,166
okay yeah when the next person comes you'd have to sir or mam them again 

582
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,200
sir it is then soldier on 

583
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,025
by your command 

584
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:23,800
I love you

585
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:25,700
you've you've saved

586
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,266
you've dislodged something in my brain

587
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:34,700
that will become essential for my future healing journey

588
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,266
thank you little wanderer

589
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:51,100
you see a sturdy woman humming to herself

590
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,776
she seems to be browsing books

591
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,566
 hello

592
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,125
and she literally made me improve my composure and suggestion

593
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:01,800
 that is true 

594
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,400
that is very true

595
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,133
she's like literally healed us

596
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,800
and I also got some of my what was it morale back something

597
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,675
and I didn't even need to down some magnesium

598
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:18,566
 no ceremonies just hello 

599
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,425
who are you 

600
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:23,200
no one i'm just a working class woman 

601
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,900
she doesn't really want to be disturbed that much

602
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:27,300
what are you doing

603
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,966
looking for something to read

604
00:38:30,366 --> 00:38:31,333
good good

605
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:32,317
it is  

606
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,346
 I'm a policeman 

607
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:34,100
 I know you are

608
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,771
do you need the help of a policeman

609
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:38,726
what with

610
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:44,333
 this citizen thinks she can do without your assistance don't buy it 

611
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,966
they all need help

612
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:51,100
interesting comment from authority here

613
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,767
let's just observe 

614
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,400
  her hands move over the book covers

615
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:02,966
the tips of her fingers look rough stained with yellow

616
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:07,300
it seems like she has spent a lot of time at work smoking 

617
00:39:07,466 --> 00:39:10,875
an array of neurons fire up with joy

618
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:14,900
 bum her a cigarette lest it turned to pain 

619
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:17,000
uh yeah

620
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
maybe we can build some rapport

621
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:19,771
do you smoke 

622
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:20,766
no I don't

623
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:26,466
what I know for a fact that you smoke

624
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:28,266
why do you think that I smoke

625
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,300
your hands look like they belong to a heavy smoker 

626
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,000
it's not like yours look much better

627
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,266
that's because I smoke

628
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:39,227
take a look at your hands 

629
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,525
  she is right    

630
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:42,850
your hands look even worse than hers 

631
00:39:43,385 --> 00:39:46,900
with tiny cuts and gushes covering your skin like a spider web 

632
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,066
your fingertips have become an ugly shade of brown

633
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:51,800
just give me a cigarette please 

634
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,366
I already told you I don't have any go bother someone else

635
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,566
she's lying she's god damn lying she has smokes

636
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:04,700
what should I do here

637
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:11,066
I feel like we're not at the point

638
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:12,933
where we're like demanding them anymore

639
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,100
but we probably would ask

640
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,400
I mean we already have a pack of cigarettes

641
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,531
don't listen to half-light

642
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,333
 yeah I'm trying not to listen to it 

643
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,266
I'm trying to think what my character would do though

644
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:30,566
well right now

645
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:34,566
like the priority is getting people not to hate us

646
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:36,712
so we're gonna move on 

647
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:37,800
  she sighs

648
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,127
maybe her husband's missing

649
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:42,500
   my husband no he's not   

650
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,866
 why did we ask this

651
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:45,575
I don't know

652
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:46,359
 so where could he be   

653
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,266
I don't know at home now

654
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,466
out drinking with his friends working

655
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:54,900
where is this going officer

656
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,629
so what I'm hearing is you don't really know where your husband

657
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:00,920
or just 

658
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:05,766
  she gives you a short nod and shifts her attention back to books  

659
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,333
maybe your children are missing

660
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,766
no absolutely not

661
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,479
okay so where are they

662
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:13,366
   are you a policeman or a nanny

663
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,838
nanny where are they 

664
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:18,525
   thet're not missing sir

665
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:23,100
 you know where they are they're at home smoking 

666
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:26,641
given the ladder of vices a chance   

667
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:27,200
what

668
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,766
what if something horrible has happened

669
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:32,166
what if they're dead

670
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,166
that's the bad vibe you got before

671
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:37,366
oh no

672
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:38,200
what if what if

673
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,848
they're at home smoking cigarettes

674
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:47,466
 such an odd way to confront someone 

675
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:51,466
what if they're in the sewers

676
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:56,717
I mean sure

677
00:41:56,717 --> 00:41:58,643
 what that's just

678
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,966
my daughters are perfectly fine 

679
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,366
they're with their friends down in Jamrock

680
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:05,329
there's nothing to worry about 

681
00:42:05,765 --> 00:42:07,766
  they are almost grown up now anyway

682
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:12,400
their past the age they need me protecting them from everything now

683
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,733
i'm afraid that danger is now greater than ever

684
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:23,866
tell me how old are they

685
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:25,766
why did they give you the option for this

686
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,400
okay

687
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,066
I don't think well

688
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:31,266
let's just ask about the Cockatoo

689
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:33,100
I don't mean to disrespect sir

690
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,200
but you are being a bit of a cockatoo here 

691
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,100
for what it's worth I agree 

692
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,566
but cockatoos can't be stopped when they get like this

693
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:43,733
it's better to indulge him at this point

694
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:45,166
there's Kim having some fun

695
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:47,982
I was asking about your

696
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,293
 ma'am I was asking about your cockatoo is it missing  

697
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,366
I don't even have a cockatoo and guess what

698
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,100
what 

699
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,066
even if I had

700
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,150
it wouldn't be missing 

701
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,200
it wouldn't be missing 

702
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,466
all right cockatoo not missing I just wanted to make sure great

703
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,268
just one more question what did you mean by me being a cockatoo 

704
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:08,225
 go read up on them if you're so interested 

705
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:10,400
 there's a great book in the bookstore  

706
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:11,335
maybe you should watch

707
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,200
if the cockatoo is your astral captain or your heraldic bird

708
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:20,600
actually that's exactly what I'm going to do 

709
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,000
we get a quest from this

710
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,800
no way

711
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,760
the story is open

712
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,666
I love this

713
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:26,725
I love this game

714
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:29,366
the woman before you nods and returns to her reading

715
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,766
I guess I can I can go read up on birds now

716
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:33,400
maybe I'll have something to talk about with Lena

717
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,133
oh this is Annette's mom

718
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,266
oh no

719
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,333
oh no this this

720
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:45,966
she's a clerk

721
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:52,766
okay

722
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:56,933
I will try to restrain myself

723
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,933
welcome to crime romance and biographies of famous people

724
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,700
my name is Plaisance 

725
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,100
be welcome and please

726
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,566
take responsibility for the energy you bring into this space

727
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,200
take responsibility for the energy you bring into this space

728
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:16,566
okay

729
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,075
a golden pendant hangs around the woman's neck

730
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:24,166
 in the shape of what looks like a tiny fish head trapped in amber

731
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:29,321
hmm a curious pendant you're wearing 

732
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:30,766
oh yes

733
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:33,800
helps to have an anchor in these times

734
00:44:37,766 --> 00:44:40,466
I could just ask her for money

735
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:44,178
I mean her business seems to be doing pretty well and we do need money sir

736
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:48,000
sir don't be ridiculous I certainly will not give you money

737
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:51,266
I would be doing you a grave psychic disfavor

738
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:53,800
one has to earn one's success

739
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,666
even if one is a police officer

740
00:44:56,366 --> 00:44:58,600
handouts are nothing but manipulation

741
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
 all they do is make you dependent

742
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,920
so who are you talking to

743
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,000
because like I handout to another adult I can understand 

744
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:14,700
but is is is like your daughter

745
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:20,350
having like basic needs met a handout in your perspective  

746
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,400
what is this insolence

747
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,100
she misunderstood

748
00:45:25,613 --> 00:45:26,500
no that's not me 

749
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,933
of course no one puts words in your mouth

750
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,900
so are you the owner of this store

751
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,600
I am the proudest owner of our little shop of culture

752
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,700
she has fine tuned her voice 

753
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,266
to find the most welcoming approach for attracting new customers

754
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:43,533
it doesn't work

755
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,900
your daughter is the one standing outside the store right

756
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,100
Annette yes

757
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,775
my daughter 

758
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:55,966
I hope she wasn't slacking off again with her nose in science fiction

759
00:45:56,166 --> 00:46:00,204
tell me was she at her post doing her job like a proper girl

760
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:06,933
 oh this is fucking this stuff pisses me off so much

761
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:12,400
no she was definitely

762
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,600
right

763
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,266
yes of course

764
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:20,550
I always thought that said

765
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,533
 no she definitely was not slacking off

766
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:26,366
was she at her post yes of course

767
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,266
wonderful did you talk to her

768
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:29,800
yes

769
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,793
 great on a scale of one to ten how compelled

770
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,900
 were you to buy books after talking with her 

771
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,400
so is that all she is to you

772
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:40,566
she's a little saleswoman

773
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,380
her opinion of her daughter

774
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,200
 depends on how well she lured you into the store

775
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:49,733
oh my god

776
00:46:49,733 --> 00:46:52,400
this fucking grates at me so much

777
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:54,966
she's the algorithm

778
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,542
ten she's very polite and helpful 

779
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:00,533
my precious

780
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,225
her dedication brings joy to my heart 

781
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:03,250
her dedication brings joy to my heart 

782
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,533
if you have children

783
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,863
I hope they turn out as great as my Annette

784
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:10,500
 now look i'm not gonna assume I'm not gonna jump into 

785
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,680
head canon that she's a terrible parent by any means

786
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,200
but

787
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:23,366
I just find this perspective very

788
00:47:25,963 --> 00:47:27,166
troubling

789
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,900
is it in my place to start commenting on her parenting though

790
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:43,133
here's what I'm thinking okay

791
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,766
at the end of the day

792
00:47:46,966 --> 00:47:49,640
Plaisance is counting her money 

793
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,266
from the amount of books that she has sold

794
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:58,533
and the first question that she has for Annette is what right

795
00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:02,366
how many books did you sell

796
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:04,200
or maybe she gives her feedback

797
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,966
we didn't sell so many books today

798
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,100
why don't you think more people came into the store

799
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,500
were you smiling at them like I told you

800
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,866
were you very polite right

801
00:48:12,866 --> 00:48:16,666
this is kind of dialogue I'm like imagining happening

802
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,500
here you have this poor young girl who

803
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:27,600
has has such a keen eye for the human condition

804
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,133
that she was able to peel me open like a fucking banana

805
00:48:36,774 --> 00:48:40,733
and yet I imagine there's not a lot of like

806
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,104
I don't know like what does Annette want to do with her life

807
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:48,000
what is she interested in well

808
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
she's definitely interested in like reading books and talking about them

809
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,066
I don't think that she hates her job but

810
00:48:57,866 --> 00:49:02,207
it does seem like she's nervous about like 

811
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,900
 what happens when when things aren't when it's not a good day

812
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,933
what happens when you know no one comes into the store

813
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:14,533
like I'm not I'm not convinced that Plaisance is sitting there

814
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:15,933
thinking like oh well

815
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,021
that's my fault

816
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:22,931
it's probably like oh well it's you know Annette didn't do her job or something

817
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,902
this sounds pretty appropriate to say 

818
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:32,266
out on the damned cold as well

819
00:49:32,266 --> 00:49:35,077
I get she's a trooper all right she looks like she can take it

820
00:49:35,077 --> 00:49:36,466
but it's actually wearing her down

821
00:49:36,466 --> 00:49:37,608
you know she's been biting her nail

822
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:42,600
 god ugh I've told her not to do that it's such a disgusting habit 

823
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:46,066
she'll get over it anxiety is a part of life

824
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:48,966
that's my fucking problem okay

825
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,066
no no it

826
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:59,328
anxiety is a part of life but not like this okay

827
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,733
little

828
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,415
like discussion on anxiety briefly

829
00:50:07,415 --> 00:50:10,500
like anxiety has a function an emotional function  

830
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,800
when someone comes in and says like I have anxiety 

831
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,400
I'm not immediately like thinking

832
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,066
that they have a generalized anxiety disorder

833
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:22,000
anxiety is your body's alarm bell

834
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,100
like to tell you to pay attention to something right

835
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:32,366
there is an amount of anxiety that's appropriate for you

836
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:34,900
if I was standing out in the cold all day

837
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:39,300
and I was worried about losing my job

838
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,758
I would experience anxiety 

839
00:50:41,758 --> 00:50:43,366
if I just went through a breakup

840
00:50:43,366 --> 00:50:44,500
I would experience anxiety

841
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,866
none of these are classified as a disorder

842
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,966
when it becomes a disorder is

843
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:55,566
when you're feeling anxious when you shouldn't

844
00:50:57,613 --> 00:51:01,956
when there is not a clear link between

845
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,133
a source of anxiety and you feeling it temporarily

846
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,300
so like

847
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:12,679
while she's standing out there working 

848
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:14,287
sure maybe she feels anxious

849
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:17,566
but if she's going up into her room and it's quiet

850
00:51:17,566 --> 00:51:19,500
and she's sitting alone in her bed at night

851
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,900
 and there is nothing that should be making her anxious

852
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,565
and that's when she's biting her nails 

853
00:51:23,565 --> 00:51:25,066
now we have a problem right 

854
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:28,881
 now the anxiety is starting to infect parts of her life 

855
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,500
where it is not appropriate

856
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,900
it's extremely sad that her mom doesn't seem to recognize this

857
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,533
she'll get over it anxiety is a part of life yeah well

858
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:50,666
what that tells me is

859
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:53,566
that someone didn't teach you how to deal with anxiety

860
00:51:53,566 --> 00:51:59,600
and you think that the way you are like that

861
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,333
you're just calling stubbornness resilience

862
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,300
and you think that the only way to get through it is just to endure it 

863
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,366
rather than actually like

864
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:12,189
I don't know providing her with like a better way 

865
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:14,166
a part of hers too clearly

866
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:15,366
yeah

867
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:16,566
yeah

868
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,300
I don't think she can do anything about it

869
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,400
she can if she has enough willpower

870
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,666
this is what's called growing pains

871
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,050
life isn't easy life doesn't give breaks 

872
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:30,300
okay now I fucking hate her okay

873
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:35,366
yeah no this is bad mom territory

874
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:44,400
willpower alone is not enough to change a negative behavioral pattern

875
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,666
I've already broken that down with the whole competing mental states thing

876
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:53,275
that motivation is a very linear way to describe action potential

877
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:54,700
 and it's very limited and

878
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,566
like oh well have you tried not being sad idiot like

879
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:02,866
that's how this sounds the way she's talking about this 

880
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,266
come on ma'am it's obvious she can't do anything about it

881
00:53:08,266 --> 00:53:11,533
you are placing an unnecessary burden on a young child

882
00:53:12,933 --> 00:53:14,766
what you're doing is wrong even I know that

883
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:16,700
and I usually don't know anything

884
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,866
here is another amazing point in our characters narrative right

885
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:30,970
like this time it is again someone else that we're interacting with

886
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:38,366
once more I feel like this right here this line of dialog

887
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:42,666
what you're doing is wrong even I know that

888
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,525
and I usually don't know anything 

889
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:47,256
is compelling us to question like 

890
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:51,000
maybe we're not a complete failure as a person right 

891
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,333
my view of myself is suddenly less and less of a mystery

892
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,133
because I'm able to tell that

893
00:53:59,133 --> 00:54:01,166
even though I'm a fucking idiot

894
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,247
and I make lots of bad decisions 

895
00:54:03,247 --> 00:54:07,100
even I can tell that this is not appropriate for a child 

896
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,369
and if I can accept that

897
00:54:10,066 --> 00:54:12,533
I can't be a complete failure right

898
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:21,066
I love this I am loving this

899
00:54:21,066 --> 00:54:24,466
and and we are very unashamed as well about saying that as well

900
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:30,200
that's perfect

901
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:35,666
she stands stiff and severe silently fuming

902
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:40,400
 ten or so seconds pass without change

903
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:45,687
this is the second boss fight of the game

904
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:52,725
this is a person coming to terms with a new reality 

905
00:54:52,725 --> 00:54:54,466
one where they are wrong

906
00:54:54,966 --> 00:54:56,413
it's not easy

907
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:58,200
no it isn't no

908
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,325
it isn't cause that's what's happening to me all the time 

909
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:02,766
oh no

910
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:06,266
hold on I need to invite her inside and apologise

911
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,166
she must be freezing out there

912
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:14,150
somehow this feels uh ingenuine

913
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:17,000
there I don't know what to say to you

914
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:20,533
my husband he tries to teach me business lessons

915
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:23,669
I have what my mother called a dull mind 

916
00:55:23,669 --> 00:55:25,366
all this stress

917
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,066
wait a second did that actually work

918
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:32,733
did that actually work

919
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,370
Annette healed us

920
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:40,266
and we were able to heal her and her mom

921
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:42,766
it sounds like both the husband and the mother

922
00:55:42,766 --> 00:55:44,900
treat her the way she treats Annette

923
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,000
what

924
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:53,700
you're like Annette to your husband and your mother

925
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:58,773
this is like this is like a fucking Raphael

926
00:55:58,773 --> 00:55:59,666
look I know he's Harry

927
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,933
Harry's the cop Raphael was the original fake persona

928
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,800
this is the therapist this is the therapist coming out

929
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:09,975
get him 

930
00:56:09,975 --> 00:56:11,847
you're like annette to your husband and your mother 

931
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:15,333
oh well my mother was horrible of course

932
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,000
absolutely perverse energies around that person

933
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:19,978
but my husband

934
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,300
 my husband is completely different of course

935
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:28,933
okay I'm we're peeling back here

936
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,966
this is a generational issue of course

937
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,466
good on her you know

938
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:38,800
I said I said bad mom territory before

939
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,733
but anyone who's willing to you know

940
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:45,666
make mistakes and known up to them like that's growth

941
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:47,300
that's character development right there

942
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,000
she's she's not a terrible mom she's a troubled human

943
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:55,423
is this husband and Annette's father

944
00:56:55,423 --> 00:56:59,225
yes my husband is a successful entrepreneur east of the river

945
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:02,698
 if only he were more involved in the business we're running up here

946
00:57:02,698 --> 00:57:04,025
 no matter

947
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:06,500
 soon we'll both be off for Grand Couron

948
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,976
Grand Couron what is that

949
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:11,333
it's a proper place to live

950
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,600
one of the most peaceful neighborhoods east of Jamrock

951
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:17,566
you may know it for its massive housing projects

952
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,866
most of the buildings are empty at the moment

953
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:23,166
it's a great opportunity to get ahead of the crowds

954
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,066
better times ahead for sure

955
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,866
and your husband's also involved (with the bookshop)

956
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:29,366
he made the initial investment

957
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,533
since then he's been what you might call silent partner

958
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:36,807
wow okay

959
00:57:36,807 --> 00:57:40,066
so here's the dynamic as well right like

960
00:57:43,966 --> 00:57:45,843
husband made the investment

961
00:57:45,843 --> 00:57:51,266
 she is left to uphold the household essentially

962
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:58,766
but doing so alone probably provokes a lot of anxiety for her as well

963
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,600
she's probably internalized a lot of

964
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,066
like the same kinds of critiques her mother gave her

965
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:06,133
which are falling down on Annette as well

966
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,300
is she an only child where are her friends

967
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,175
yes I'm afraid so 

968
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,235
a real treat she is 

969
00:58:13,235 --> 00:58:14,978
it would be nice if she had

970
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,897
no we couldn't have afforded more children really  

971
00:58:17,897 --> 00:58:19,366
not in this economy

972
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,200
true

973
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,333
very true also in real life

974
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:30,200
plenty of my friends have kids

975
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,733
and I'm gonna be honest sounds miserable in this economy

976
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:40,166
a glimmer of sadness blinks through the world crafted exterior

977
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,216
I look I came in hot on this one but  

978
00:58:47,218 --> 00:58:47,954
the poor clerk 

979
00:58:47,954 --> 00:58:50,800
it's always a clerk sad clerk

980
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,361
I want to help her now

981
00:58:53,056 --> 00:58:54,366
 where is your husband

982
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,000
where is he let me go talk to him

983
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,466
tell him to come home and be here for his family

984
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,900
of course yes this economy

985
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:10,800
she told me she doesn't go to school anymore  

986
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,966
she's been too busy helping me here

987
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:15,537
so she studied at home this trimester

988
00:59:15,537 --> 00:59:17,632
this is a temporary solution of course

989
00:59:19,466 --> 00:59:20,466
ah and she

990
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,475
she doesn't get to go to school this is heartbreaking

991
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,333
 okay I really want to do

992
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:30,766
a family session with all of them

993
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,308
it's so sad 

994
00:59:36,308 --> 00:59:37,533
I assure you

995
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:40,800
I of all people understand the importance of education

996
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:44,075
she will be back in school the moment the store takes off 

997
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,075
 and when is that going to happen

998
00:59:47,266 --> 00:59:48,542
okay had something else in mind

999
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:49,766
 the woman looks aloof

1000
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,166
her features much softer

1001
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:55,575
occasionally she glances at her daughter's silhouette

1002
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:58,333
 ah you can tell that she 

1003
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,666
she probably really does know what she's doing to her daughter

1004
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:06,466
but

1005
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,766
her daughter is a very good person and is very agreeable

1006
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:15,200
and so doesn't show very openly the toll it takes on her

1007
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,966
I know this is all super emotional and stuff

1008
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,566
but where are the books on cockatoos

1009
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:26,066
a book about cockatoos

1010
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:27,555
there should be one upstairs 

1011
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:29,939
right next to the shelf of biographies 

1012
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,607
what if I want to buy

1013
01:00:31,607 --> 01:00:33,366
then why are you talking to me

1014
01:00:33,866 --> 01:00:36,178
everything is on the shelves to browse  

1015
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,666
don't you feel compelled to buy anything

1016
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:43,300
see those shelves there go be drawn

1017
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:45,066
What types of books do you have

1018
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:47,566
everything is on the shelves take a look yourself

1019
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,825
the shelves compel you don't they

1020
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:53,340
 she's attempted to mentally direct you towards the shelves

1021
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,566
 she only wants  you to buy the goods 

1022
01:00:55,566 --> 01:00:57,736
she doesn't care about the books

1023
01:00:57,736 --> 01:00:59,709
 do you even know what books you have for sale

1024
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:01,407
 truth be told  not really 

1025
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,455
 my sister brings in most of the goods

1026
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:07,266
 I'm sure it's all very literary stuff with well written prose 

1027
01:01:07,266 --> 01:01:12,166
but you don't learn about the important things in life from fabricated stories 

1028
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,533
 wrong that's wrong 

1029
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:21,466
I have learned lots of important things about life  from this fabricated story  

1030
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:26,966
I've undergone more personal change in the 10

1031
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:29,500
or so episodes of this series that I have made

1032
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,300
in the last couple of weeks

1033
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,933
than I have gotten from just real life things happening to me

1034
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,100
like most of my recent character development in real life

1035
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,877
is a direct result of playing this video game

1036
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:46,500
 less something that really happened to me 

1037
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,666
which is probably characteristic of lots of my life to be honest

1038
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:56,933
where do you learn about important things

1039
01:01:56,933 --> 01:01:56,966
truth is available if you just know where to look

1040
01:01:56,966 --> 01:01:59,396
the truth is available if you just know where to look

1041
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:02,766
and you have to open and free your mind to understand

1042
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,000
okay I sympathize with you lady

1043
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,500
but I find your personality also very grating

1044
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,733
she smiles and nods seemingly relieved

1045
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,923
farewell for now book peddler okay

1046
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,400
let's get in that opinion on this

1047
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:26,266
I'm sorry sir

1048
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:27,733
I can't talk right now

1049
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,505
i'm very busy with my homework 

1050
01:02:29,505 --> 01:02:31,435
I have so much homework now

1051
01:02:31,435 --> 01:02:31,466
i'm very busy with my homework I have so much homework now

1052
01:02:31,466 --> 01:02:33,575
you just can't win

1053
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,200
 no for a nuts

1054
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,466
what are you doing

1055
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:41,225
maths it's really difficult like really  

1056
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:43,466
they say you need it to get rich 

1057
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,433
better than standing outside in the cold I guess 

1058
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:48,966
 oh oh I found something while you were away 

1059
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,800
I thought this would fit you 

1060
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,415
like thanks for helping out not me the city I mean  

1061
01:02:54,415 --> 01:02:55,966
like a detective does

1062
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:00,696
she gives you a hat 

1063
01:03:00,696 --> 01:03:03,866
almost exactly like one Dick Mullen wears on the covers 

1064
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:05,766
oh my gosh

1065
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:08,766
where did you get

1066
01:03:08,766 --> 01:03:10,494
just what Dick Mullen would ask  

1067
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:12,333
I got it from behind the curtains

1068
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,933
I'm not really supposed to go there

1069
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:16,340
it's of a fedora 

1070
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,925
may be it's the hat Dick Mullen wears all the time

1071
01:03:18,925 --> 01:03:20,922
 you look way more serious with that

1072
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,174
 right  I have to get back to my homework now before mum notices 

1073
01:03:25,174 --> 01:03:27,066
man  this is hard 

1074
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,866
can I spend can I stop doing the murder thing

1075
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:36,266
and just spend time with her and Frittte girl and Cuno

1076
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:44,066
oh my god it really is cool

1077
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,300
if anything this wide

1078
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,566
rimmed hat looks even better than the hat Dick Mullen wears

1079
01:03:49,933 --> 01:03:51,800
Dick Mullen is stupid and not even real

1080
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,700
you're real your brain is real

1081
01:03:54,366 --> 01:03:56,800
your real brain is inside the hat

1082
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:01,866
and it's good for my encyclopedia it's ooh

1083
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:06,223
that my bum hat was pretty good for my reaction speed though 

1084
01:04:06,223 --> 01:04:08,817
trade it out oh fuck Yeah

1085
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:12,900
put our duster back on as well now we look fucking cool

1086
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:20,600
how helping kids how would that prevent crime 

1087
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,266
well it would probably prevent future crime

1088
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,466
so we've just gone on a crazy little adventure this

1089
01:04:32,957 --> 01:04:34,957
I know that we haven't really done anything in the game

1090
01:04:34,957 --> 01:04:38,191
but psychologically a lot of things have happened

1091
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,000
like what does this mean

1092
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,133
what does this mean for our character to be recognized like this

1093
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:50,133
that someone can actually idolize us even right

1094
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:55,066
I think that

1095
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,533
there's a part of us that's starting to understand a little more clearly like 

1096
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,700
what people think about us

1097
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,700
 this was a very eye opening experience 

1098
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,900
to see what kim's reaction and the mother's reaction

1099
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,066
and Annette's reaction to us was

1100
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,600
I think what we learned is that we actually have some convictions 

1101
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:39,900
right we actually do have some firmly held beliefs

1102
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:43,335
that dictate some of our behavior

1103
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,133
and we can notice that there is a link between like

1104
01:05:49,566 --> 01:05:52,133
it doesn't matter that we lack intelligence

1105
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,100
our convictions are still

1106
01:05:55,766 --> 01:05:56,566
the same

1107
01:06:03,766 --> 01:06:06,600
hey good night seachelle thanks for stepping by

1108
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:12,733
we've learned that we have some convictions right that

1109
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:21,200
we care about microeconomics and the sad state of all clerk shop owners 

1110
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,800
and there is a direct link I think between

1111
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:30,333
clarifying what our convictions are

1112
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:36,800
this is another protective factor against shame right

1113
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,325
the more convictions we invest in  

1114
01:06:41,325 --> 01:06:43,425
the more we explore things

1115
01:06:43,425 --> 01:06:47,333
 like I do care about  the emotional wellbeing of children  

1116
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:52,925
I do care about them being able to have the opportunity to go to school to learn  

1117
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:55,291
 to have their family around

1118
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:59,700
 these are things I do not need to feel any sort of shame in 

1119
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,733
and the more I expressed those convictions

1120
01:07:03,566 --> 01:07:05,266
the more I was respected

1121
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:12,466
so I would say that like respect

1122
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:17,866
we were unsure about whether

1123
01:07:17,866 --> 01:07:20,000
we were respected by other people

1124
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:23,425
and there is a link between conviction and respect 

1125
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:26,075
the more we live  a moral life

1126
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,335
 the more we show people that  

1127
01:07:29,249 --> 01:07:30,866
we don't abuse our power

1128
01:07:30,866 --> 01:07:33,700
that we don't need to use authority

1129
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,066
like we didn't need to yell at the mother

1130
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:37,533
we just needed to empathize with her a little bit

1131
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:40,066
not only did she open up to us

1132
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:44,733
which makes us feel good about the kind of like police work we can do 

1133
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:51,133
but it also earns some respect from her and Kim and ourselves

1134
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:54,600
our view of ourselves is changing more and more right

1135
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:59,666
I think that this is trading places in some ways

1136
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,866
getting interesting

1137
01:08:09,956 --> 01:08:13,333
there's a lot going on here right like and

1138
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:19,666
I did this once before I don't think I'm gonna do it now

1139
01:08:21,466 --> 01:08:23,500
but there was a time where

1140
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,166
I had it in mind to actually do two of these

1141
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:37,666
like because Harry's life is also a mystery to himself

1142
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:40,066
like his past life is an unknown right

1143
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:44,133
so we could technically like go a layer deeper and say like well

1144
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:45,600
the more we learn about him

1145
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:49,968
what are the aspects of his life

1146
01:08:50,466 --> 01:08:55,266
that are starting to come into his awareness here right

1147
01:08:55,266 --> 01:08:56,866
like for example

1148
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,666
the breakdown of his relationship

1149
01:09:02,466 --> 01:09:05,600
which he may have been in his blind spot right

1150
01:09:06,133 --> 01:09:14,166
is now becoming something he knows privately in his current life 

1151
01:09:15,766 --> 01:09:18,600
 and what is the intersection of that

1152
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,400
so maybe we return to this at some point and

1153
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:37,700
maybe we do another johari window later in the game

1154
01:09:42,991 --> 01:09:44,333
herry saying those things

1155
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:46,500
because he knows that's what people say to be respected

1156
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,166
or because he actually believes in those things

1157
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:48,966
I think at this point

1158
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:50,366
it's an actual belief

1159
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:57,150
okay let's check out those cockatoo books

1160
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,250
ohh what's right in this curtain

1161
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:03,725
you see a set of tattered curtains blocking the way to another room 

1162
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:07,500
a strange cage-like trinket dangles from the curtains

1163
01:10:07,691 --> 01:10:08,950
excuse me officer

1164
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,800
the back room is strictly for employees only

1165
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,670
I'm doing police work 

1166
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,781
shopkeeper what's behind the curtains

1167
01:10:18,325 --> 01:10:20,125
why aren't you browsing the books

1168
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:23,200
don't you feel *compelled* to look at the books

1169
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,956
something shady's going around

1170
01:10:24,956 --> 01:10:25,025
something shady's going around

1171
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,975
the more she tries to draw you away from the curtains 

1172
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,925
the more alluring they become

1173
01:10:31,425 --> 01:10:32,300
examine 

1174
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,175
you see some kind of charm

1175
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,075
an irregular polyhedron

1176
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,253
assembled from bones sticks and straw  

1177
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,925
inside a disturbing fish-head

1178
01:10:42,266 --> 01:10:44,850
with empty eye sockets stares at you 

1179
01:10:46,566 --> 01:10:47,225
that is curious 

1180
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:49,569
aside from poking at it suspiciously

1181
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:53,208
there is nothing else to do with the fish-head charm at this time

1182
01:10:53,733 --> 01:10:55,850
the curtains remain shut before you

1183
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,533
maybe we can sneak them open

1184
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,707
I don't just want to like thrust them open

1185
01:10:59,707 --> 01:10:59,766
I don't just want to like thrust them open
（选项）暂时不管那个窗帘

1186
01:10:59,766 --> 01:11:00,940
we've just earned her trust

1187
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:03,250
lets check out that book

1188
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,675
so they put a cockatoo mission in here just for kicks 

1189
01:11:14,466 --> 01:11:16,200
turning into the middle of the streams

1190
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,066
and seeing the diagrams and little red strings connecting everything is wild yeah 

1191
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:26,166
like I said long time viewers this is like

1192
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:31,000
this is a pretty tame johari window actually  

1193
01:11:31,325 --> 01:11:34,466
compared to like some of the other ones that I've done

1194
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:39,866
but we also were working with very little right now

1195
01:11:39,866 --> 01:11:42,150
which is that we still don't know a lot about Harry

1196
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,666
whereas like some of the other Johari windows

1197
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:46,925
I've done into like 10 episodes of the show

1198
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:52,100
these shelves are overburdened with books from the same series

1199
01:11:52,466 --> 01:11:56,000
you see the name Dick Mullen over and over

1200
01:11:57,175 --> 01:11:59,550
shopkeeper what's all this crime fiction 

1201
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:01,975
oh crime robberies murders

1202
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,225
even *sexual* crimes

1203
01:12:04,525 --> 01:12:08,056
we're fortunate to have Dick Mullen and his stories to sort all that out 

1204
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:12,925
you're a police officer apparently

1205
01:12:13,533 --> 01:12:15,229
you should buy *all* of these

1206
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,750
they really do teach a person how to be a proper detective

1207
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:20,700
maybe I should actually do that let's look through 

1208
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,000
crime fiction is a disgrace

1209
01:12:23,725 --> 01:12:27,576
an asinine misrepresentation of the physical attributes  

1210
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,175
of the arduous everyday work of actual police officers 

1211
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,775
these books *greatly* overstate the excitement of police work

1212
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,725
glossing over how long it takes

1213
01:12:36,725 --> 01:12:40,225
to actually follow up on leads and eliminate dead ends 

1214
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,600
I don't know it's been pretty exciting

1215
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,508
furthermore they have NO IDEA

1216
01:12:44,508 --> 01:12:47,725
how hard it is to simply remove a body from a tree

1217
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:52,000
let's be real that part was super fucking easy

1218
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,707
because I just shot the motherfucker down first try 

1219
01:12:55,707 --> 01:12:58,275
what's more they completely ignore

1220
01:12:58,425 --> 01:13:01,693
the psychological hardships of year after year

1221
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,575
coming into contact with people during the worst days of their lives

1222
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:10,867
not a single mention of all the stress this work creates upon the officer's *family*

1223
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:14,300
detective fiction just doesn't tell the truth at all

1224
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,900
now would you like a list of the books found on the shelf  

1225
01:13:18,825 --> 01:13:20,966
where is this coming from this is odd to me 

1226
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:22,725
like this doesn't have a voice

1227
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:24,850
whose opinion is this

1228
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:29,566
at of all the dialogue options in the game

1229
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:30,766
this is like just very

1230
01:13:32,766 --> 01:13:33,532
a blunt

1231
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,580
it's interesting 

1232
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,933
I mean it just seems like commentary

1233
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:41,850
like more so than anything my character would into it

1234
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,300
you see Dick Mullen on the Job 

1235
01:13:45,775 --> 01:13:46,763
Get Me Mullen

1236
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,150
The Stalwart Adventures of Richard P. Mullen 

1237
01:13:50,575 --> 01:13:52,850
Dick Mullen and the Murder in the Orchard 

1238
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:55,675
The Sordid Affair of Dick Mullen

1239
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:59,966
it's an objective opinion

1240
01:13:59,966 --> 01:14:03,725
A Killing Is Declared Dick Mullen in the Murderhouse

1241
01:14:04,366 --> 01:14:08,117
The Final Case of Dick Mullen an obvious lie  

1242
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:10,400
Dick Mullen in the Clock Tower

1243
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:13,095
The Ordeals of Dick Mullen

1244
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:14,725
Dauntless Dick  

1245
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,525
Dick Mullen's Funeral Pyre 

1246
01:14:18,475 --> 01:14:20,025
The Murder of Dick Mullen

1247
01:14:20,466 --> 01:14:21,416
he probably doesn't die

1248
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:22,116
he probably doesn't die
哦 不是的

1249
01:14:22,116 --> 01:14:22,200
he probably doesn't die

1250
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,800
turns out he faked it to solve a case 

1251
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,600
of course 

1252
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,366
yes

1253
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,900
there's also The Dame Who Did It 

1254
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:30,851
Farewell My Mullen

1255
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,925
faking death seems to be a common trope in the Mullen series 

1256
01:14:35,466 --> 01:14:37,775
The Morbid Tales of Dick Mullen 

1257
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,223
A Dark Tide Turns

1258
01:14:40,533 --> 01:14:44,605
Tragedy Calls for Dick Mullen another one with fake death

1259
01:14:45,066 --> 01:14:46,200
and of course

1260
01:14:46,466 --> 01:14:48,025
Dick Mullen The Murderer  

1261
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,875
in order to catch a murderer 

1262
01:14:49,975 --> 01:14:52,750
dick mullen must *become* the murderer 

1263
01:14:55,766 --> 01:14:57,800
that's got to be some kind of foreshadowing here right

1264
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,295
come on this is *not* the way real police solve crimes  

1265
01:15:02,675 --> 01:15:05,825
the *real* police are some twenty kilometres away

1266
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,350
sitting in an armoured motor carriage

1267
01:15:08,775 --> 01:15:10,119
come on Chester

1268
01:15:10,366 --> 01:15:11,710
tell the story again 

1269
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,881
what again man I tell that one at least once a month 

1270
01:15:16,133 --> 01:15:17,650
it's not that interesting 

1271
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,416
the *fuck* it is and these guys haven't heard it

1272
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:19,674
the *fuck* it is and these guys haven't heard it
这段对话是从哪来的

1273
01:15:19,674 --> 01:15:21,400
the *fuck* it is and these guys haven't heard it

1274
01:15:22,025 --> 01:15:23,900
you see Chester here

1275
01:15:26,025 --> 01:15:26,985
gosh why

1276
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,225
one civilian looks on amazed the bald man reply

1277
01:15:31,225 --> 01:15:34,425
a very fucking dangerous case ain't that right Chester  

1278
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,464
they almost got you that time 

1279
01:15:36,725 --> 01:15:38,075
yeah sure came close 

1280
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:42,150
all right so I was tailing this guy called Francis the Shoe 

1281
01:15:45,475 --> 01:15:48,300
the inside of the motor carriage is thick with cigarette smoke

1282
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,270
outside it starts to rain

1283
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:53,575
after all of this you still haven't found the answer to the one question that matters

1284
01:15:54,225 --> 01:15:56,145
who *is* Dick Mullen

1285
01:15:56,675 --> 01:15:58,075
who is he react 

1286
01:15:58,975 --> 01:15:59,591
your attempt to grasp at the answer fails 

1287
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:00,691
your attempt to grasp at the answer fails 
妈的

1288
01:16:00,691 --> 01:16:01,350
your attempt to grasp at the answer fails 

1289
01:16:01,866 --> 01:16:03,425
it seems very close by 

1290
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:06,585
pulsating just out of reach 

1291
01:16:06,585 --> 01:16:08,275
whatever we don't need to being

1292
01:16:08,275 --> 01:16:10,600
 to do all this book read in anyways 

1293
01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:15,966
oh yeah that's true 

1294
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:19,414
one of the cops called me Dick Mullen to make fun of me

1295
01:16:21,675 --> 01:16:23,691
loving the series on YouTube so happy to catch your life

1296
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:25,366
I'm happy you're here thank you

1297
01:16:28,066 --> 01:16:33,000
the plaque on the shelf reads Biographies of Famous People you see

1298
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,448
you see no I don't give a fuck about that  

1299
01:16:34,448 --> 01:16:35,700
I want the cockatoo book

1300
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:42,375
this bookstore is not strictly about crime romance and biographies of famous people 

1301
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:46,304
there's also a wide range of paranatural literature

1302
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,933
amidst the various books

1303
01:16:48,933 --> 01:16:53,075
you find one written by someone named Matthias W Dundas

1304
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,100
it's about Wholeness Unity Balance

1305
01:16:57,366 --> 01:17:00,300
the point of the book and many others on this shelf

1306
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,700
is to give people medicinal advice in situations

1307
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,050
where they don't have access to paid health services

1308
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:08,532
it serves platitudes
“那是怎么运作的呢”

1309
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:09,100
it serves platitudes

1310
01:17:09,366 --> 01:17:12,475
while also telling everyone that traditional medicine

1311
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:15,000
the kind people don't have access to

1312
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,915
and which cost more than this book is garbage

1313
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,075
and would only give you cancer anyway

1314
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:22,900
without even curing your cold or anything

1315
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:25,700
Wholeness Unity Balance

1316
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:29,000
on the other hand can basically take care of anything

1317
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:31,350
though it is important to note

1318
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,366
when it's up to your mind to heal yourself

1319
01:17:34,466 --> 01:17:38,500
then it's because of your mind that you're *ill* in the first place 

1320
01:17:39,566 --> 01:17:42,566
when it's up to your mind to heal yourself

1321
01:17:42,566 --> 01:17:45,325
then it's because of your mind that you're ill in the first place 

1322
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:50,966
no

1323
01:17:51,975 --> 01:17:55,133
no no no

1324
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:58,366
it's your own fault if you're ill got it

1325
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,525
the book features chapters on topics such as

1326
01:18:06,525 --> 01:18:08,125
how to find magnesium

1327
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:08,366
镁 我确实很需要这玩意

1328
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:11,325
it even lists plants you can harvest magnesium from

1329
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:13,533
how to continue drinking

1330
01:18:13,533 --> 01:18:16,375
if you're an alcoholic who has destroyed his liver 

1331
01:18:16,891 --> 01:18:18,766
and there's even a chapter

1332
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:23,679
on the ancient Seraise tradition of using duck gold ladder preservatives  

1333
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,485
to treat and prevent sexually transmitted diseases 

1334
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,893
pre- and post-factum apply  

1335
01:18:30,225 --> 01:18:31,503
nothing worth buying

1336
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:33,341
this is just mundane garbage what's even paranatural about this

1337
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,232
this is just mundane garbage what's even paranatural about this
我也是这么想的

1338
01:18:35,232 --> 01:18:35,666
this is just mundane garbage what's even paranatural about this

1339
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:41,225
fucking 97 percent chance find something truly otherworldly

1340
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,700
the throbbing in your head increases

1341
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:43,725
the throbbing in your head increases

1342
01:18:43,725 --> 01:18:46,575
with every passing moment you gaze at this shelf  

1343
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:49,133
suddenly as if out of nowhere

1344
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:51,758
a small green book becomes apparent

1345
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,100
the title of it reads Medicinal Purposes of the Pale

1346
01:18:56,339 --> 01:18:56,733
“灰域是什么”

1347
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:57,123
the book contains very little explanation on the matter
“灰域是什么”

1348
01:18:57,123 --> 01:19:00,500
the book contains very little explanation on the matter

1349
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:03,543
this knowledge seems to be taken for granted

1350
01:19:03,874 --> 01:19:04,733
what's this book about

1351
01:19:04,733 --> 01:19:09,192
the book contains descriptions of various pseudo-scientific therapies 

1352
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,886
alternative medicines and folk remedies

1353
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:16,075
 involving *the pale* also known as *le territoire* 

1354
01:19:16,775 --> 01:19:20,792
for example it recommends vigorously swatting one's naked body 

1355
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:24,524
 with a venik or hand broom made from 

1356
01:19:24,524 --> 01:19:28,550
the leafy twigs of a young birch tree from the near-pale 

1357
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,496
even better if you can find someone else 

1358
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,950
preferably a large man dressed in nothing but a towel  

1359
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:40,166
to thresh you while you're spread naked and helpless on a cool slab  

1360
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:41,400
that sounds painful

1361
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,732
it is supposedly invigorating and good for the circulation

1362
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:46,503
行吧  “还有别的吗”

1363
01:19:46,503 --> 01:19:47,141
it also recommends consuming distilled spirits 
行吧  “还有别的吗”

1364
01:19:47,141 --> 01:19:49,925
it also recommends consuming distilled spirits 

1365
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:53,275
like vodka or whisky that have been aged in the pale

1366
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:57,264
readers are instructed to cover these jars in a shallow hole

1367
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:02,000
just inside the pale and leave them there for 30-60 days

1368
01:20:02,366 --> 01:20:04,300
depending on the potency desired

1369
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:07,120
okay what does this pale aged liquor do

1370
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,700
among other benefits 

1371
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:12,342
it is alleged to restore a damaged liver to perfect health

1372
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,600
what that's got to be impossible

1373
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,925
I should probably get my hands on some of that where what else is in there 

1374
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:18,625
for general health and well-being

1375
01:20:18,866 --> 01:20:22,337
readers are encouraged to take regular strolls through the pale

1376
01:20:22,966 --> 01:20:27,425
though a sidebar cautions readers to limit each stroll to less than an hour 

1377
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:32,300
these strolls promise to cleanse the mind of warriers and the body of toxins  

1378
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:36,775
especially if the perambulator performs this ritual in the nude

1379
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,004
nudity figures prominently in a number of these prescriptions 

1380
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,052
this is exactly what you need

1381
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:46,800
so this reminds me of going to like

1382
01:20:49,425 --> 01:20:52,400
I went to this museum in my town

1383
01:20:54,575 --> 01:20:57,900
a little Dutch town at the Netherlands 

1384
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:01,300
they had this museum of medicine

1385
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,533
and it was like all kinds of old practices and medicine

1386
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:06,300
and shit like that dating back like

1387
01:21:07,683 --> 01:21:09,228
centuries ago

1388
01:21:09,925 --> 01:21:11,733
fucking weird stuff

1389
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:15,400
like reading some of the books and

1390
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:20,800
seeing the diagrams and seeing the instruments and all of the weird shit 

1391
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,914
that we used to think about how the body works

1392
01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:26,233
was so fascinating and horrifying

1393
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:30,550
really weird this is what that reminds me of 

1394
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,800
I don't know

1395
01:21:32,266 --> 01:21:34,200
I don't want to be the party-pooper

1396
01:21:34,366 --> 01:21:38,950
but this *pale territory* sounds sort of dangerous

1397
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,575
maybe you shouldn't walk in it naked 

1398
01:21:43,016 --> 01:21:43,966
“还有什么要注意的吗”

1399
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:44,376
there's an entire section devoted to cures for men
“还有什么要注意的吗”

1400
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:47,000
there's an entire section devoted to cures for men

1401
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,200
who are struggling to perform their *marital obligations*

1402
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,414
I certainly don't need that

1403
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:54,600
you close the book

1404
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,900
and return it to its place on the shelf

1405
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,500
I guess we could buy the book

1406
01:22:03,825 --> 01:22:04,875
I don't see why not

1407
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,133
we'll find another way to make money

1408
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:12,951
indeed something about that book does seem to have spoken to you

1409
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,766
well I hope it contains what you're looking for

1410
01:22:19,566 --> 01:22:20,975
where's that fucking Cockatoo book

1411
01:22:20,975 --> 01:22:25,819
several maps have been attached to a bulletin board hidden inside the alcove

1412
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,300
they're held up by small pins

1413
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,600
the board has come loose from one corner

1414
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:32,900
the maps look old and faded 

1415
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,340
your eye catches a map of Inculinde

1416
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,836
a map of Revachol and a map of Martinaise

1417
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,775
yeah I do need to pay for my room 

1418
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:43,925
we'll figure it out we'll find another way to get money 

1419
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,250
oh shit wait I this is where I could buy maps isn't it  

1420
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:53,241
can I buy these maps

1421
01:22:53,241 --> 01:22:54,366
can I buy these maps
抱歉 警官

1422
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:57,041
the map of Martinaise is the only one available

1423
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,192
the other two are not for sale anymore

1424
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,500
and besides you could scarcely afford them

1425
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,300
they're quite valuable

1426
01:23:04,366 --> 01:23:05,582
though they might not look it 

1427
01:23:05,582 --> 01:23:07,025
the map of Martinaise is 90 cents though

1428
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:08,073
the map of Martinaise is 90 cents though
好吧 好便宜

1429
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:09,000
好吧 好便宜

1430
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,250
that old thing

1431
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:10,266
that old thing

1432
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:12,983
it's an out-of-date map of a tourist location  

1433
01:23:12,983 --> 01:23:14,847
that never was nor came to be from

1434
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:18,855
from when some *design-studio people* tried to spruce the place up 

1435
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,533
 four or five years ago 

1436
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:23,025
they also renovated the horse-statue 

1437
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,329
set up those coin-operated viewers

1438
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:27,441
and designed the new street lamps

1439
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:31,025
oh there's fast travel that's extremely useful

1440
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:32,875
they didn't get that far 

1441
01:23:33,515 --> 01:23:34,625
I want to buy the map 

1442
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:34,637
oh

1443
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:37,166
a shame the project never got going

1444
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,258
would be nice if someone fixed Martinaise up

1445
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:42,570
all these ruins are bad for business

1446
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:50,766
I could just try to take the map

1447
01:23:50,766 --> 01:23:51,950
but I don't I don't 

1448
01:23:52,825 --> 01:23:54,000
let's just buy the map

1449
01:23:54,466 --> 01:23:55,650
this is for Annette

1450
01:23:56,225 --> 01:23:57,908
 I don't want to defame

1451
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,133
the work that she has done

1452
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:04,866
always good to be informed of your surroundings

1453
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:06,616
the north coast of a verdant island
（选项：查看瑞瓦肖地图）

1454
01:24:06,616 --> 01:24:07,533
the north coast of a verdant island

1455
01:24:07,533 --> 01:24:09,600
is shattered by the delta of a river

1456
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,760
it is the River Esperance

1457
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:15,166
countless bridges put the shards back together

1458
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:17,478
connecting city blocks to river islands

1459
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,775
*La Delta* says a great artificial heart in the centre

1460
01:24:21,466 --> 01:24:24,165
teeming with lifeforms and construction

1461
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:33,035
fast travels broken okay

1462
01:24:33,425 --> 01:24:35,425
to the east rolling hillsides

1463
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:37,933
Le Jardin Stella Maris

1464
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,337
the suburbs of Saint-Batiste swallowed up into the megacity

1465
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,400
they sound *rich* to you this is Revachol East

1466
01:24:46,879 --> 01:24:47,216
“那河流西边呢”

1467
01:24:47,216 --> 01:24:47,933
Couron it's somewhere to live not bad
“那河流西边呢”

1468
01:24:47,933 --> 01:24:49,975
Couron it's somewhere to live not bad

1469
01:24:50,533 --> 01:24:53,125
then there's Jamrock it's *bad*

1470
01:24:53,701 --> 01:24:56,150
people shouldn't live there but they do

1471
01:24:56,837 --> 01:25:01,317
then Faubourg it's almost *as* bad and much larger 

1472
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,485
then Coal City it's the worst 

1473
01:25:04,825 --> 01:25:05,759
it's so small you can't even see it on the map 
“那马丁内斯呢”

1474
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:07,050
it's so small you can't even see it on the map 

1475
01:25:07,525 --> 01:25:09,617
no wait there it is

1476
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,166
north of Jamrock

1477
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:15,111
the strip of coast next to the Greater Revachol Industrial Harbour 

1478
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:17,927
it looks downright despondent

1479
01:25:18,475 --> 01:25:20,881
it's almost Coal City to be honest

1480
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,323
no Coal City is worse  

1481
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,500
a charred limb

1482
01:25:24,975 --> 01:25:27,826
rain falls on its slick black streets 

1483
01:25:28,274 --> 01:25:31,922
then there's the Burnt-Out Quarter in the heart of Jamrock

1484
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,133
is it cold in this bookstore

1485
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:35,961
or is it just *you*

1486
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:39,533
Shivers this is the best fucking

1487
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:45,150
just the most unique voice out of all of the different scales

1488
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:45,800
just the most unique voice out of all of the different scales
（平心定气）不

1489
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,750
this is somewhere to be

1490
01:25:48,225 --> 01:25:49,866
this is all you have

1491
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,575
but it's still something

1492
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:56,119
streets and sodium lights the sky the world

1493
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:58,133
you're still alive

1494
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,300
fuck volition

1495
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:06,800
getting it's getting real

1496
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:10,637
that's a great line

1497
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:14,112
this is somewhere to be this is all you have 

1498
01:26:14,112 --> 01:26:15,416
but it's still something

1499
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:20,225
streets and sodium lights the sky of the world are still alive

1500
01:26:23,366 --> 01:26:27,566
another thing that this is touching on is this right here

1501
01:26:27,566 --> 01:26:29,966
this is becoming more and more

1502
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,300
centralized to our character's view of himself right

1503
01:26:39,566 --> 01:26:44,033
and I think that was so well punctuated by that dream sequence

1504
01:26:44,977 --> 01:26:47,865
the line that sticks out to me is you've you've failed everyone 

1505
01:26:47,865 --> 01:26:49,500
it's not just like you failed yourself 

1506
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,756
you failed who you used to be

1507
01:26:52,756 --> 01:26:54,420
you failed the police precinct 

1508
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,700
you failed your relationship

1509
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,400
you failed Kim

1510
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:03,700
this is like it told us that we failed every single person alive

1511
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:07,983
and everyone who's ever lived as well 

1512
01:27:07,983 --> 01:27:11,400
like that is such a deep level of

1513
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:17,300
uncertainty about your worth to the world

1514
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:22,866
and that your life is even worth protecting

1515
01:27:24,766 --> 01:27:27,466
everything we have done today despite not

1516
01:27:27,466 --> 01:27:30,800
again not really progressing the narrative of the game very much

1517
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,035
has told me a very distinct psychological narrative

1518
01:27:36,035 --> 01:27:38,666
about what Harry is experiencing

1519
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:43,300
what is so central about this fear of failing everyone

1520
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:50,967
about how much shame and regret has been driving our negative behaviors 

1521
01:27:51,991 --> 01:27:53,300
up until this point

1522
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,133
we're starting to make better decisions

1523
01:27:55,133 --> 01:27:57,209
and I think it's because we're seeing evidence

1524
01:27:57,209 --> 01:28:01,866
 that this is not something that is known to ourself anymore

1525
01:28:01,866 --> 01:28:02,900
we're not sure

1526
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,800
we are not sure if this is known to ourselves anymore

1527
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,766
we are starting to question if it is true right

1528
01:28:10,766 --> 01:28:12,366
we are moving it to the unknown

1529
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,656
and in doing so 

1530
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:19,933
we start to wonder if we should feel the level of shame that we do

1531
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,733
we're starting to wonder

1532
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:27,966
we're starting to get more comfortable with the convictions that we have

1533
01:28:28,966 --> 01:28:32,600
we're starting to feel less worried that people see us as fragile

1534
01:28:32,866 --> 01:28:35,306
which is something to be exploited and manipulated 

1535
01:28:35,306 --> 01:28:37,766
and more so that we're struggling

1536
01:28:37,766 --> 01:28:41,366
meaning that we're someone to be empathized with and actually helped

1537
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:46,400
we are only aware of those opportunities

1538
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,133
because we do not feel that we are this anymore

1539
01:28:49,133 --> 01:28:50,459
or we're starting to 

1540
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:51,665
I think that 

1541
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:55,866
if we feel we are so unworthy that we have failed every single living person

1542
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:01,000
we don't feel like we deserve anyone's empathy

1543
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:03,866
and we don't feel like our convictions matter

1544
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,666
when we start to displace that

1545
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:09,205
we're starting to 

1546
01:29:09,622 --> 01:29:11,700
this is the healing taking place

1547
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:20,066
all of these things start to move now in our view of ourself

1548
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:24,952
and this completion of failure

1549
01:29:24,952 --> 01:29:27,600
 I think this motion right here is the most important one

1550
01:29:28,974 --> 01:29:31,700
that failure is becoming an unknown

1551
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,333
and our view of ourself is starting to develop

1552
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,200
it's not known to other people quite yet but

1553
01:29:40,006 --> 01:29:41,166
it's starting to

1554
01:29:41,852 --> 01:29:43,466
grow a little bit

1555
01:29:44,798 --> 01:29:48,866
you're starting to find a hope after experiencing so much failure and loss exactly

1556
01:29:49,853 --> 01:29:51,744
we're finding hope

1557
01:29:51,744 --> 01:29:55,417
that there is a child in this world like Annette who

1558
01:29:55,417 --> 01:29:59,966
seems to have kept some of her humanity locked away

1559
01:29:59,966 --> 01:30:03,300
behind the hardships that she's gone through

1560
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:07,200
we're finding that even someone like Frittte girl

1561
01:30:07,466 --> 01:30:11,166
who seemingly has no prospects

1562
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:13,100
if put into a different environment

1563
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,866
would probably excel right

1564
01:30:16,397 --> 01:30:18,066
we're finding that

1565
01:30:19,879 --> 01:30:22,266
even Annette's mother right

1566
01:30:22,266 --> 01:30:23,728
given a little guidance 

1567
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:25,431
was able to see that 

1568
01:30:25,431 --> 01:30:29,933
she was putting the priority of the business over her own daughter 

1569
01:30:30,066 --> 01:30:31,900
and her health and safety

1570
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,800
like there is a little bit of hope coming through

1571
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,666
and I also think that there was hope coming through

1572
01:30:39,266 --> 01:30:43,500
when we spoke with Kim at the end of the last day

1573
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:46,066
which is

1574
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:50,466
we talked about why are we doing this

1575
01:30:50,466 --> 01:30:54,021
why are we solving the crime

1576
01:30:54,352 --> 01:30:59,133
remember how I said it it's not always clear what our own intentions are

1577
01:31:00,971 --> 01:31:03,266
like our intentions are often

1578
01:31:05,428 --> 01:31:06,480
unknown

1579
01:31:06,946 --> 01:31:11,343
why are we working on this case is it to impress someone is it to 

1580
01:31:12,022 --> 01:31:15,771
make up for something that we did wrong 

1581
01:31:16,075 --> 01:31:16,933
is it

1582
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,600
is it because

1583
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:26,766
we feel like it will fill in the missing pieces like is it selfish

1584
01:31:27,519 --> 01:31:28,800
we're not sure

1585
01:31:29,663 --> 01:31:32,874
we are starting to develop awareness that somethings we do 

1586
01:31:32,874 --> 01:31:36,966
not because they're for anyone but because we believe in them right 

1587
01:31:37,663 --> 01:31:40,466
and that's kind of the dialogue that we had with Kim

1588
01:31:40,466 --> 01:31:43,333
which was like we're doing this because we believe in something

1589
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,900
we believe it's the right thing to do

1590
01:31:45,908 --> 01:31:50,341
we believe that by putting some order to the chaos of this environment

1591
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:55,000
potentially all of these people who are broken down Frittte girl

1592
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,630
the guy in the pawn shop 

1593
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:59,266
Annette Annette's mother

1594
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,266
even people like Joyce and Evrart

1595
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:07,400
there is this little bit of them that feels like given different circumstances

1596
01:32:09,356 --> 01:32:10,333
they would

1597
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,900
do different things with the skills that they have you know

1598
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,666
potentially someone like Evrart wouldn't use his tactics for manipulation

1599
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:24,700
but as like strong leadership for people

1600
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,940
yeah I think that there's a little bit of like

1601
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:38,133
we're seeing hope bleed through the cracks

1602
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:42,733
a little bit in this environment and

1603
01:32:45,266 --> 01:32:48,133
I think that this whole chapter of our adventure

1604
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:52,586
are starting to actually see the patterns of change here

1605
01:32:52,806 --> 01:32:56,466
now that I feel confident this is being worked on

1606
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,666
maybe we are not a complete failure

1607
01:32:59,933 --> 01:33:02,933
maybe there are some convictions that we genuinely have

1608
01:33:03,133 --> 01:33:06,600
maybe everyone doesn't think that we're a fucking loser and

1609
01:33:08,228 --> 01:33:10,666
maybe there are some good qualities

1610
01:33:11,533 --> 01:33:15,566
maybe potentially more qualities that are good than bad

1611
01:33:17,841 --> 01:33:20,933
now I do actually feel ready to go look in the mirror

1612
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:30,666
now I do feel like there is enough psychological work taking place that 

1613
01:33:33,012 --> 01:33:34,205
seeing some hope in the world 

1614
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:38,866
and seeing ourselves actually able to make positive changes with Annette

1615
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,333
and Annette's mom

1616
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:43,933
and other people that we're helping

1617
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:48,800
means that there's some protection

1618
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:52,900
here

1619
01:33:58,449 --> 01:33:59,700
so I'm gonna do it

1620
01:34:00,466 --> 01:34:01,466
I'm gonna do it

1621
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,500
I fuck you fuck all of you guys okay

1622
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,566
I'm gonna I gonna lock you all up

1623
01:34:09,425 --> 01:34:10,400
Lena

1624
01:34:10,665 --> 01:34:13,447
you have been instrumental in my healing process 

1625
01:34:13,447 --> 01:34:16,566
Garte you know what you as well

1626
01:34:22,533 --> 01:34:23,533
I'm ready

1627
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:31,133
and Kim I think more than anyone else I have felt

1628
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,293
has shown me what I was looking for

1629
01:34:35,728 --> 01:34:43,733
 which is moments of guidance and support and loyalty 

1630
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,442
that don't feel consequential

1631
01:34:47,442 --> 01:34:50,966
 like that he's doing them because he expects something from me

1632
01:34:50,966 --> 01:34:54,166
I feel like he's shown me

1633
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:57,333
that some of it comes from genuine care for us

1634
01:34:58,733 --> 01:34:59,533
so

1635
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,872
I think it's time

1636
01:35:02,872 --> 01:35:05,933
especially now that we've got a cool hat on that we got from Annette

1637
01:35:06,533 --> 01:35:11,866
like that genuinely boosts our characters confidence a lot in my head cannon

1638
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:16,000
a mirror hangs on the wall

1639
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:18,110
covered in steam 

1640
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:20,200
you cannot see yourself

1641
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,000
just the outlines of a man

1642
01:35:23,366 --> 01:35:30,000
you have no memory of the face that awaits you there underneath the soft vapor 

1643
01:35:30,066 --> 01:35:30,866
really

1644
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:36,403
or recollection of the person you are the people in your life and even the world you're in 

1645
01:35:36,403 --> 01:35:38,885
has drowned in a sea of blood alcohol 

1646
01:35:39,381 --> 01:35:41,566
this was no mere night of drinking

1647
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,366
it was a deluge of world ending proportions

1648
01:35:48,631 --> 01:35:53,364
as you slowly reach your hand towards the surface of the mirror 

1649
01:35:54,456 --> 01:35:55,366
abort

1650
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,547
you clearly have not thought this through 

1651
01:35:57,547 --> 01:35:59,466
you won't like what you see there

1652
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,340
and you will never unbecome it

1653
01:36:01,862 --> 01:36:02,933
 that's okay

1654
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:10,666
part of me understands that I won't like what I see

1655
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:19,996
not being okay with that 

1656
01:36:19,996 --> 01:36:23,966
means I'm afraid that this is what I will find to be true

1657
01:36:23,966 --> 01:36:27,133
but something has told me that this is no longer true right

1658
01:36:27,133 --> 01:36:28,966
I'm not a complete failure

1659
01:36:29,166 --> 01:36:34,138
and so I'm okay with discovering that there are parts of myself that I don't like

1660
01:36:34,138 --> 01:36:38,066
 and starting to sort of make peace with them

1661
01:36:38,066 --> 01:36:40,076
especially how I look to other people 

1662
01:36:40,076 --> 01:36:43,733
because everything I've shown to people around me has been

1663
01:36:45,148 --> 01:36:46,359
disgusting 

1664
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:49,466
it's been confrontational

1665
01:36:49,466 --> 01:36:53,366
it's been vulgar it's been desperate

1666
01:36:53,366 --> 01:36:54,800
it's been embarrassing

1667
01:36:54,966 --> 01:36:57,446
and despite all of that 

1668
01:36:58,214 --> 01:36:59,792
Kim has stuck around me

1669
01:36:59,792 --> 01:37:03,466
people like Annette still see good in me they still give me things

1670
01:37:03,666 --> 01:37:06,733
people have still asked me for help people still want me around

1671
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,828
and so there simply cannot be something

1672
01:37:09,828 --> 01:37:12,800
 so affronting about my appearance

1673
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,508
if all of those things are true

1674
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:16,800
so now we have to look

1675
01:37:22,511 --> 01:37:26,533
you have no idea who this thing is do you

1676
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,143
this is the face of a late stage alcoholic

1677
01:37:36,143 --> 01:37:37,153
 too late 

1678
01:37:37,534 --> 01:37:39,902
you clearly have rigomortis on your face

1679
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:42,643
oh wait is that an expression

1680
01:37:42,643 --> 01:37:46,500
are you trying to make an expression with that face why

1681
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,846
I have no idea why it's there it just is 

1682
01:37:52,846 --> 01:37:54,000
please stop

1683
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,333
it's horrible you're scaring yourself

1684
01:37:59,566 --> 01:38:02,666
oh my god you can't stop

1685
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,300
it's like it's not even voluntary anymore

1686
01:38:05,841 --> 01:38:08,797
you have worn that grin into your face and now it won't come off 

1687
01:38:09,168 --> 01:38:10,766
what does it even mean

1688
01:38:11,366 --> 01:38:13,500
what is the emotion you're trying to convey

1689
01:38:19,966 --> 01:38:22,900
it's insinuating that I'm vaguely sympathetic

1690
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,400
I think I'm sort of pulling it off too

1691
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,533
in a sad has-been kind of way there is some charm to it

1692
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:31,700
I think it's more appropriate to say that

1693
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,200
it is an expression of pain right

1694
01:38:38,524 --> 01:38:39,566
when I like

1695
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,600
cover

1696
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:49,933
this part of it up like the smile

1697
01:38:53,466 --> 01:38:55,166
it looks painful to me

1698
01:38:59,635 --> 01:39:01,600
it tells a very different story

1699
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:03,366
when you only see this side of it

1700
01:39:07,461 --> 01:39:08,733
you are correct

1701
01:39:16,466 --> 01:39:18,933
there's a lot of things we can't do here yet

1702
01:39:24,988 --> 01:39:26,933
guess we'll let the mirror be for now

1703
01:39:40,133 --> 01:39:43,866
I guess we can try the tool right

1704
01:39:44,266 --> 01:39:47,133
we have chaincutters is that what we needed to use or

1705
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:51,604
a mirror hangs on the bathroom wall

1706
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:56,184
in it your face adorned with the expression

1707
01:39:56,943 --> 01:40:01,708
I think there was a item that gave us more Interfacing

1708
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,733
yeah some gloves

1709
01:40:10,793 --> 01:40:12,766
a mirror hangs on the bathroom wall

1710
01:40:12,766 --> 01:40:17,733
in it your face adorned with the expression

1711
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:18,933
okay guys

1712
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,166
lucky tomatoes in the chat for Harry facing himself

1713
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:27,800
we need some seriously lucky tomatoes here

1714
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,700
okay 28 percent

1715
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,500
I just don't know if it's doable

1716
01:40:43,024 --> 01:40:43,900
okay

1717
01:40:44,933 --> 01:40:47,401
we've got lucky tomatoes going 

1718
01:40:48,276 --> 01:40:49,666
let's roll the dice

1719
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:52,366
the chaincutters is slip out of your hands 

1720
01:40:52,366 --> 01:40:55,113
as you attempt to twist the faucet into place

1721
01:40:55,336 --> 01:41:00,133
well you know one thing for sure you've probably never been a plumber

1722
01:41:02,933 --> 01:41:04,666
we didn't make it

1723
01:41:06,266 --> 01:41:09,100
I mean there's nothing wrong with trying these right

1724
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:11,966
they're white checks

1725
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:15,369
I can just try to use this 

1726
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:20,100
it belongs in the new the third decade of the current century

1727
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:20,921
what

1728
01:41:20,921 --> 01:41:23,604
enough time had passed from the failure of the revolution

1729
01:41:23,604 --> 01:41:25,800
 that for a fleeting moment 

1730
01:41:25,966 --> 01:41:33,066
free market economy seemed like the ultimate uncontested way of life for our species

1731
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:38,100
so with the chaincutters and the fucking gloves

1732
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,466
I couldn't bust the sink off

1733
01:41:40,466 --> 01:41:43,966
but what I could do is use my brain power to  

1734
01:41:45,883 --> 01:41:49,650
think my way through the problem with an eight percent check holy shit 

1735
01:41:51,566 --> 01:41:52,966
encyclopedia two

1736
01:41:52,966 --> 01:41:54,586
and I rolled two sixes

1737
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:59,555
 that is the perfect roll that is literally the best roll

1738
01:42:00,209 --> 01:42:02,133
I could get fucking critical success

1739
01:42:05,066 --> 01:42:08,400
well I'm going to be honest that this doesn't really mean much to me 

1740
01:42:08,533 --> 01:42:09,966
I didn't really understand it

1741
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:13,100
it belongs in The New the third decade of the current century

1742
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:15,533
Enough time had passed from the failure of Revolution that 

1743
01:42:15,666 --> 01:42:16,500
for a fleeting moment

1744
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,600
free market economy seemed like the ultimate

1745
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,424
 uncontested way of  life for our species 

1746
01:42:20,424 --> 01:42:21,266
okay 

1747
01:42:21,533 --> 01:42:23,200
that's my real reaction

1748
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:23,933
 Things were good

1749
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,376
It was "smooth sailing"

1750
01:42:26,376 --> 01:42:32,475
People made gold-and-champagne-tinted interiors and facades to suit the times 

1751
01:42:32,475 --> 01:42:34,800
 calling this "The New Style" 

1752
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:36,733
But more importantly

1753
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:38,600
disco happened

1754
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:39,175
disco

1755
01:42:39,175 --> 01:42:41,900
For Revachol your city 

1756
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:46,333
that meant only one thing Guillaume Le Million 

1757
01:42:47,333 --> 01:42:51,166
out of the dazzling swirl of Disco music in an open air

1758
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:54,878
boite de nuit somewhere in a Revachol west  

1759
01:42:54,878 --> 01:42:57,933
Guillaume's blonde mane appeared on the screen

1760
01:42:58,533 --> 01:43:03,100
he sang some bullshit then he made the expression

1761
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,900
okay

1762
01:43:09,066 --> 01:43:10,300
how long ago was the there

1763
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:13,500
There is a vast ocean of time between right now

1764
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:18,275
and the expression looking good on you or anyone  

1765
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:22,100
two decades if the calendar is to be trusted 

1766
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,800
humanity has run aground in that time

1767
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:27,644
it's a different world  now  

1768
01:43:27,644 --> 01:43:29,533
the expression is a relic

1769
01:43:30,333 --> 01:43:32,073
so I adopted it why

1770
01:43:32,073 --> 01:43:33,566
 everyone loved it

1771
01:43:33,966 --> 01:43:37,500
maybe you thought some of the stardust would rubber from you

1772
01:43:38,066 --> 01:43:39,195
maybe it did

1773
01:43:39,195 --> 01:43:41,800
 either way it's all gone now 

1774
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,634
only the grimace remains

1775
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,066
 anything else like who am I

1776
01:43:47,066 --> 01:43:48,300
why did I become a cop

1777
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,866
why did I drink myself into oblivion

1778
01:43:49,866 --> 01:43:53,582
you have some understanding of the near history of disco

1779
01:43:53,582 --> 01:43:57,000
 plus the trivia you've picked up along the way 

1780
01:43:58,025 --> 01:44:01,300
episodic memory however remains in the dark 

1781
01:44:01,566 --> 01:44:05,466
it may never return you should prepare yourself for that

1782
01:44:07,266 --> 01:44:09,266
you have some understanding

1783
01:44:10,933 --> 01:44:14,572
episodic memory remains in the dark and may never return

1784
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,585
something will always potentially be incomplete 

1785
01:44:20,585 --> 01:44:23,466
about our view of ourselves right 

1786
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:29,900
like there's gonna be a part of our memory that lives

1787
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:39,333
like somewhere in the unknown that is just a

1788
01:44:41,266 --> 01:44:43,798
we'll never get access to it right

1789
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:50,566
can we develop a full picture of ourself without access to this

1790
01:44:50,966 --> 01:44:52,100
that's a good question

1791
01:44:53,666 --> 01:44:55,333
personally I do think so

1792
01:45:02,533 --> 01:45:03,563
I guess that's it then 

1793
01:45:03,563 --> 01:45:04,866
 it doesn't have to be

1794
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,583
you can swoon over Guillaume 

1795
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:09,200
and the champagne cook smile whenever you want to  

1796
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,100
maybe some of the stardust will return

1797
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,500
hmm man wait a second

1798
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,099
I thought that was the eight percenter

1799
01:45:21,057 --> 01:45:22,300
 I failed that one

1800
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,391
yeah I think it was even lower than that

1801
01:45:33,391 --> 01:45:35,333
 see if I can win this one I don't know 

1802
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:40,066
it's too Late Like an image on film

1803
01:45:40,766 --> 01:45:46,100
The Expression belongs to your primary motor cortex

1804
01:45:46,133 --> 01:45:51,533
it would take a minor neurological miracle for you to cease producing it 

1805
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:55,266
gotcha my chances went out for that one okay

1806
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,900
well that is our

1807
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,800
expression now

1808
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:06,200
we've got a new thought we've almost internalized this one

1809
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,566
so I'm curious to see where this ends up

1810
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,079
wait a second wait a second wait a second

1811
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:21,466
does that say minus one to authority for rigorous self-critique

1812
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:30,666
what have I been saying this whole time dude 

1813
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:32,387
I totally didn't even realize that

1814
01:46:32,387 --> 01:46:35,210
 I have been saying this whole analysis  that  

1815
01:46:36,342 --> 01:46:42,200
trying to use authority to protect people from 

1816
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,603
like seeing how fragile we are  

1817
01:46:46,973 --> 01:46:51,381
because we're afraid of being manipulated for our desires

1818
01:46:51,381 --> 01:46:55,633
 was the result of shame and regret and all of these things

1819
01:46:55,633 --> 01:46:59,733
 like it's this  the reason we've been acting out through authority 

1820
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:04,100
when we have started doing the self critique

1821
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:05,966
maybe we're not a complete failure

1822
01:47:05,966 --> 01:47:07,566
what is our view of ourself

1823
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:10,166
what should we apologize for

1824
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,500
what are our good convictions

1825
01:47:13,133 --> 01:47:14,700
what does it mean to be vulnerable

1826
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,566
and let people empathize with us

1827
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,200
we no longer feel the shame

1828
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,700
and we stop trying to appeal to authority

1829
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,333
so the fact that like

1830
01:47:23,733 --> 01:47:26,630
the game also recognizes this 

1831
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:34,266
that being sorry lowers your points in authority like that's 

1832
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:39,400
that's some serious psychological synergy

1833
01:47:41,766 --> 01:47:44,266
god damn I did not even realize

1834
01:47:45,856 --> 01:47:47,900
that they just knew what they were doing they

1835
01:47:48,166 --> 01:47:50,333
that the people who made this game had

1836
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:59,785
such a strong grasp on what seems like every angle of the human condition  

1837
01:47:59,785 --> 01:48:01,933
psychological political 

1838
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,300
social and

1839
01:48:06,866 --> 01:48:08,400
biochemical as well

1840
01:48:08,866 --> 01:48:13,900
right and like the fact that there are game mechanics that demonstrate that 

1841
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,333
I mean it's fucking incredible

1842
01:48:16,666 --> 01:48:20,333
it doesn't really explain why having a hobo hat

1843
01:48:21,066 --> 01:48:22,900
gives me better reaction speed

1844
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:27,400
but does it need to

1845
01:48:28,466 --> 01:48:30,366
does it need to is the question

1846
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:36,466
I knew something was missing here

1847
01:48:36,466 --> 01:48:43,300
I didn't have my my handy flashlight out to inspect everything

1848
01:48:51,866 --> 01:48:55,100
and it was initially written by eight people that's incredible

1849
01:48:58,466 --> 01:49:01,700
disco elysium actually the best game ever made it may actually be 

1850
01:49:03,366 --> 01:49:06,333
so I do think that that means

1851
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:10,166
that our appearance right

1852
01:49:13,933 --> 01:49:15,933
has now traveled

1853
01:49:21,733 --> 01:49:25,666
no I guess our appearance would have been the blind spot

1854
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:32,600
i'm running out of space here our appearance has now entered

1855
01:49:34,266 --> 01:49:35,100
the arena

1856
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:43,903
and I would say that its connection is

1857
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:47,000
closely related to this right here

1858
01:49:47,366 --> 01:49:48,600
the fact that we're struggling

1859
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,333
because it's something that people can evidently see

1860
01:49:52,566 --> 01:49:54,866
and it's part of the addiction

1861
01:49:57,166 --> 01:50:00,900
it's part of what we look like as a cop

1862
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:06,400
it's part of why someone like an Annette was able to sympathize with us 

1863
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,300
and like call out that

1864
01:50:09,266 --> 01:50:12,566
hey you look sober you look distinctly sober right like

1865
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:19,500
so learning about our own appearance

1866
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,266
that it's now something that can live in the arena

1867
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:29,366
what does that do to our view of ourself again 

1868
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,600
it brings it this way

1869
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:40,400
but it also allows other people to see

1870
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,300
like the connection to right

1871
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:45,133
like rigorous self critique

1872
01:50:45,133 --> 01:50:47,566
isn't just an internal thing it's an open thing

1873
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,900
especially now that we know what we look like

1874
01:50:54,182 --> 01:50:54,982
so

1875
01:50:57,733 --> 01:50:59,166
a very interesting

1876
01:51:01,733 --> 01:51:03,933
Johari window for Mr Harry

1877
01:51:04,066 --> 01:51:05,500
it's definitely incomplete

1878
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,266
and I feel like maybe what I will do is

1879
01:51:09,933 --> 01:51:10,922
freeze this

1880
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:15,300
you know I can take the stuff away if I need to

1881
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:18,766
but what I will probably do at some point

1882
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:31,966
do you like

1883
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:36,366
scrubbing me

1884
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,900
another one of these

1885
01:51:47,333 --> 01:51:49,066
and on that one

1886
01:51:50,666 --> 01:51:52,500
when we learn more about

1887
01:51:58,133 --> 01:52:01,500
um Mr Duboa's past

1888
01:52:04,866 --> 01:52:13,000
we will do the double layered johari window 

1889
01:52:18,066 --> 01:52:19,400
so will save that one

1890
01:52:22,466 --> 01:52:24,566
no hahaha it's gonna be intense

1891
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:32,333
but okay I think that this is going to be

1892
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:34,766
our stopping point for the evening

1893
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,746
what a way to cap it off 

1894
01:52:38,746 --> 01:52:42,848
with finally looking at ourselves in the mirrors with our cool cowboy hat  

1895
01:52:43,664 --> 01:52:47,400
and learning so much about ourselves as well

1896
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,133
this playthrough just continues to

1897
01:52:54,566 --> 01:52:56,866
blow my mind with

1898
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,947
how naturally it unfolds 

1899
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:08,700
 despite me taking forever to like play the game

1900
01:53:10,733 --> 01:53:12,466
like the game is happening

1901
01:53:13,066 --> 01:53:15,000
but the character development is

1902
01:53:16,733 --> 01:53:18,200
so apparent to me

1903
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,936
despite they're not like

1904
01:53:20,936 --> 01:53:24,100
 to me it's it's like a kind of implicit storytelling 

1905
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:30,200
where we are writing the narrative

1906
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:33,066
that's happening where is implicit storytelling

1907
01:53:33,066 --> 01:53:36,133
would be like the game saying

1908
01:53:37,966 --> 01:53:40,400
Harry is discovering this about himself

1909
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,866
it would be basically telling versus showing

1910
01:53:44,766 --> 01:53:50,200
so much of this game has been amazing for its implicit storytelling 

1911
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,286
the fact that looking in the mirror

1912
01:53:52,294 --> 01:53:55,530
 is something we decided to do after we experienced

1913
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:58,849
 enough self security to go and do it    

1914
01:53:59,429 --> 01:54:00,933
like that's not the game deciding

1915
01:54:00,933 --> 01:54:04,766
you wake up and you look in the mirror and you learn about this

1916
01:54:04,966 --> 01:54:09,266
no it's very implicit and reactive to us

1917
01:54:09,266 --> 01:54:11,466
that's what's so amazing about it to me

1918
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:13,717
