1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:00,933
hello

2
00:00:01,384 --> 00:00:04,866
and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series 

3
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:05,733
on today's episode

4
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:10,333
we're going to address something kind of unavoidable in a game like this 

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,533
which is what are some of the crossovers between politics and mental health 

6
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:21,266
and kind of some personal struggles I have about integrating those two subjects 

7
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:25,500
i'm sure there will be a lot of discussion about this in the comments

8
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,866
just note that this is all recorded previously

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,033
I think I'm gonna probably make a dedicated video

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,778
it's some point kind of like compiling my thoughts a little more 

11
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:41,633
but yeah we get an early look at kind of where my mind is coming from on this 

12
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:42,500
aside from that

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,733
we have a very special moment in this episode

14
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:50,866
which is finally we're going to reach the end of our first day as a detective 

15
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:51,833
it's taken us a while

16
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,128
and we're going to take another look at how 

17
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:56,500
 Kim and I's relationship has been developing

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,866
over this very challenging day

19
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:03,200
and see if there's actually some things we've become quite close on 

20
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,466
so all that's coming up I'm excited to get into it

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,800
let's do it

22
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,733
all right we

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
are gonna talk to Kim

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,966
we should think about calling it a day maybe

25
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,733
the nights are still miserably cold this time of year

26
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,400
I haven't paid the cafeteria manager for the damages yet

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,466
you should take care of that then

28
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:25,833
but I don't have the money

29
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,100
(let's) talk to him anyway

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,833
an officer of the RCM shouldn't be sleeping in the street

31
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,733
we'll figure something out

32
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,500
though he finds this situation frustrating

33
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:39,266
he is doing his best to not make you feel any worse than you already do 

34
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,300
I respect that Kim

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,527
yeah his Kim has won a lot of points with me this

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,566
these chapters of our stream

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,933
okay let's see if we can reason with this gentleman

38
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,366
can I help you

39
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,433
but I don't have another option here

40
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,300
yes have you got it

41
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,466
can we come to some sort of arrangement

42
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,700
that arrangement include you pay me

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,766
what we already agreed

44
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:15,800
you owe me

45
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,300
Kim is about to say something

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,866
let him lets do that

47
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:25,066
I understand your predicament as the manager however

48
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:27,700
I feel I must remind you

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,066
that we are here to conduct an important investigation

50
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,400
that also affects your business

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,866
that's a good point put the squeeze on

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,566
forgive me for saying this

53
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:42,066
but your colleague seems more committed to drinking and

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,233
establishment sentence

55
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,500
he shrinks back a bit under the lieutenant severe gaze

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,233
I mean no offense it's really nothing personal

57
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:57,066
I just have to protect the interests of this establishment

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,900
kitty

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,333
hold on I still have my key you know

60
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,966
good luck trying to use it

61
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:11,000
he taps his foot on a against a metal box

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,270
that's installed in the back of the counter

63
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,566
all the locks have an electronic component

64
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:18,057
they have to be unlocked down here with a master key  

65
00:03:18,057 --> 00:03:21,400
before your guest key will open the lock 

66
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:29,400
sorry my cat is chewing on the wires of this thing

67
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,933
all the locks have an electronic component

68
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,700
they have to be unlocked down here with a master key

69
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,000
before your guest will open the lock

70
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,866
I don't really want to break the door down but

71
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,708
this conversation isn't going anywhere is it

72
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,533
not until you bring me the money

73
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:52,966
come on man help me out

74
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,200
I might have something in my motor carriage

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,133
we can use when you're done here

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,600
I really didn't want to resort to this

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,233
the man is thinking

78
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,166
oh lieutenant

79
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,500
we're done here

80
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,266
yes have you got it

81
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,600
does that arrangement include you pay me

82
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,479
what we already agreed

83
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,933
you owe me

84
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,733
i'm an honest cop

85
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,066
i'll pay you back tomorrow

86
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,733
as a police officer you must understand

87
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:25,166
that I cannot take you at your word without evidence

88
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:25,966
shit

89
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,466
evidence being money

90
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,900
you can't stay here without money

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
what if I break the door down

92
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:34,733
oh wonderful try to do that

93
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,733
i'll have to call you an ambulance

94
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,533
shit

95
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:39,166
not until you bring me the money

96
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:39,833
okay

97
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,200
damn it

98
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:40,900
I might

99
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,933
I really didn't

100
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,166
oh lieutenant

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,566
okay let's go check it out

102
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:53,500
what disorder what I diagnose are detective with

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:04,400
I would diagnose him with alcohol use disorder severe

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,933
which the diagnostic code should be F1020

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,533
and I would also diagnose him with

106
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:26,900
either a chronic major depressive disorder or

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,800
persistent mood disorder

108
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,566
I would not give him borderline personality disorder no

109
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,966
he does not have not in

110
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,133
the range of things that we have done

111
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,500
nor anything that I have told him to do

112
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,000
represent like a borderline case to me

113
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:58,366
no DSM-5-TR right now until they updated again

114
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,433
borderline would be like severe attachment issues

115
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:11,300
putting people on pedestals

116
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:16,333
taking things very personally

117
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:21,800
like I would never stop asking him questions

118
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,100
seeking his approval his validation at the same time

119
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,065
like while we're doing that we are looking for earnest ways to self reflect 

120
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:36,000
 and that's something that takes a lot of work

121
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,733
in a borderline case to get to

122
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:48,933
so I would not he does not have a boardline personality disorder 

123
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:53,333
I don't actually see any like personality stuff

124
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,966
like personality disorders are a

125
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,466
it's not just like

126
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:09,133
like you can overcome depression right like you can

127
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,933
do a lot of work on personality disorders

128
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,500
but it's like your lens

129
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,200
 through you see the whole world through

130
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,100
and it's a failure to cope with things

131
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,900
in a healthy and productive way

132
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,133
but to a point that like

133
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,566
it just needs a lot of intervention

134
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:38,466
and what I'm finding is that the character we're playing as

135
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:42,033
will be able to overcome his issues

136
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:45,400
through lots of self reflection

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
earnest conversation

138
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,500
discovery of his past self

139
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,933
and integration of the positive parts

140
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,866
and acceptance of the negative parts

141
00:07:55,866 --> 00:08:06,800
like I find that he will be able to do a lot of healing experientially 

142
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,666
indulging in self harming behaviors watch out yeah

143
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,133
that's true

144
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,633
self destructive mean we don't know

145
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,200
if he's been self harming like

146
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:26,466
explicitly

147
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,933
but for example

148
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,400
right like I would see

149
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,553
the behavior of someone with BPD in that conversation with Gart  

150
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:39,933
not submitting to the idea

151
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:44,466
that I will go find another way to do this you know

152
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,566
that is consistent with a moral responsible like ethical code

153
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,157
moral code social code

154
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,700
 I would just be

155
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,866
lot more persistent and confrontational

156
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:06,766
what about the amnesia ah

157
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,466
I mean

158
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,666
my dude just

159
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,900
I don't know he's lost his memories

160
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,333
I don't really know a lot about amnesia or anything

161
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,533
hey Abydos welcome to the stream

162
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:25,000
okay let's check out what's in kim's motor vehicle here

163
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,400
inside you see a set of steering levers a radio microphone 

164
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:31,766
a pullout toolbox

165
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:35,400
and the soft glow of the fuel preheater cage

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,900
I have something here we could sell

167
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:42,733
look in the back in the suspect transport enclosure

168
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,500
transport enclosure regular people just call it the cage

169
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:51,066
I think it's some kind of schizophrenia

170
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:55,033
these voices and hearing objects sound abnormal too personalized

171
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,766
so it would not be schizophrenia because

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,533
for it to be any kind of schizophrenia

173
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:09,400
schizoeffective schizoid personality

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,333
like the kinds of hallucinations

175
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:17,566
when you're diagnosing that you have to ask the person

176
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,311
like do you hear voices 

177
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:20,233
and they might say yes

178
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,066
and you might say do you hear these 

179
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,800
voices like out in the world

180
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,900
or are they in your own mind

181
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,600
if they're in their own mind

182
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,000
this is not a hallucination right

183
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,733
these may be intrusive thinking

184
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,300
but like that's not a hallucination

185
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,666
those are your own thoughts and he has personified these thoughts

186
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,300
I don't know if that's a diagetic thing like

187
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,533
if he if we were to talk to the detective

188
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,466
would he say yes I hear volition

189
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:54,800
or would is that just something the game calls it

190
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:04,400
so no it wouldn't be anything schizo typal in that sense

191
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,266
he is aware their internalizations

192
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:13,100
he acknowledges he's personified the tie

193
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,066
yeah we haven't heard much from the tie

194
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,533
I guess that would be a hallucination but yeah

195
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:25,366
we haven't heard the tie speak

196
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:32,733
do you think the BDI would be helpful

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,066
a BDI would be is always a good idea

198
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,966
I think that he's depressed for sure

199
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,966
okay he's got something in the suspect transport enclosure 

200
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:46,733
let's look

201
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,066
the cage at the back of the motor carriage

202
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,600
looks rather uncomfortable

203
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:54,300
four shiny hubcaps are stacked against the seat

204
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,822
the silver edges sparkle in the dark 

205
00:11:57,822 --> 00:11:58,933
well but for example

206
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:02,400
when we hear inland empire and it like talks from

207
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,333
somewhere is that in his own mind

208
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,133
I guess actually there is something to be said

209
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,700
for like when we heard the corpse talking

210
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,866
this could be a hallucination

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,300
we didn't really get to investigate like more

212
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,066
that could be a schizophrenic thing yeah

213
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,666
I don't know that's not really like my

214
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,066
wheelhouse

215
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,066
so I could be wrong on some of that stuff

216
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,600
but you can also have hallucinations

217
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,066
and not be like diagnostically

218
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,800
ah schizophrenic

219
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:01,733
right like I've hallucinated things before under stress

220
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,133
which our character is very much under frequently

221
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,933
four shiny hubcats are stacked against the seats

222
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,533
I confiscated this for a little while back

223
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:17,666
we can take them to the pawn shop down by the matines canal

224
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,049
okay so there is a pawnshop

225
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:22,466
what are those things

226
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,433
they're spinner hubcaps

227
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,266
frivolous things you put on your wheels

228
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:26,866
when the wheels come to a stop

229
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,066
the caps keep on spinning

230
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,566
there's no real use for them it's just for vanity

231
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,466
okay

232
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,400
I like how he does the spinning motion with his hands

233
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,333
that's a nice little bit of characterization

234
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,066
a vanity he wouldn't mind

235
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,666
what do you mean you confiscated them

236
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,533
a couple weeks ago I stopped a young man

237
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,733
for going slower than the speed of traffic

238
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:55,566
turns out he was some coalition official's son and high

239
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
so you took his spinners

240
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:06,366
I took them and arrested him for driving under the influence

241
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:13,866
so kim's got a he's got a flexible side to him as well 

242
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:14,766
hmm

243
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,333
I would have confiscated them too they're mesmerized

244
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,600
that they are I was going to take them into evidence

245
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,800
but they weren't necessary for conviction

246
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,666
he never asked for them back

247
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,300
um did you want to put these spinners on your machine

248
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,200
no no

249
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,466
that would be silly I just I don't know why I kept them

250
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,600
it doesn't matter I couldn't put them on this MC anyway

251
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
a cup with spinners that would be outrageous

252
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,766
yes outrageously cool

253
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:51,700
he flashes a smile barely visible in the dark

254
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,533
there's a little bit of that fun personality hiding in there

255
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,200
ah

256
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,600
ah this is this is

257
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,533
my heart is breathing

258
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,700
I'm sorry you have to sell them because of me

259
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,833
that's so fitting for us

260
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:24,014
and I feel like is an arriving at a genuine point in our relationship right

261
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,266
I know that there's a lot of people who have been sort of confused

262
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:33,500
why I wasn't like immediately sold on Kim

263
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,533
not Brady the human

264
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,566
I have liked him just fine from the beginning

265
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:42,333
but like my character I've been saying that he

266
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,266
that we're not trusting him

267
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:50,700
because I'm legitimately waiting for like

268
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,966
real moments where this is put to the test where like

269
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,766
I'm asking myself like does

270
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:09,162
who benefits but not in like a conspiracy sort of way  

271
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:11,333
but like does he benefit from

272
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:16,800
is he doing this just because he 

273
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:20,018
this is about the case and we need somewhere to stay for tonight 

274
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:24,025
or like is he actually showing genuine interest in my well being  

275
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,200
and this time I feel like he is

276
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:33,500
and he's and I'm picking up on that like he's willing to put this 

277
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,225
he flexed his own morality to get these things 

278
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:40,915
because there was something in him that enjoyed them 

279
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:45,400
and he's willing to give them up for me like 

280
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,275
I'm able to perceive that as the character now 

281
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:51,566
in a way I don't think my character would have perceived that at all

282
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:55,150
yeah he doesn't have to do this he doesn't have to do it this way 

283
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,911
and based on like the narrative of I just 

284
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,850
gave back the pendant to Lena

285
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:07,750
like I am now primed after that experience as the character 

286
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:16,266
to recognize that people do not part ways with things of value easily

287
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:22,075
when the trade is purely emotional right 

288
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:25,800
like Lena cares about me she was willing to do that

289
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,325
Kim must care about me if he's willing to do this 

290
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:36,300
they're not like heirlooms to him but it it was something that he

291
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,833
collected 

292
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,465
flexed his own you know professionalism to get them 

293
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:47,325
and now that he is giving them up for me for this is quite in passion 

294
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:52,200
I feel it's only right that we apologize to him for this 

295
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,710
as I said they're useless anyway  

296
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:58,333
I should have remembered I have these earlier

297
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,133
but thank you

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
okay

299
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,066
we're becoming closer

300
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,900
there is a path forward for Kim and I

301
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,766
and I think that he's okay with this as well

302
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:20,750
it's doing just as much good for him to do this for me 

303
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,066
I don't think I need to deny this the way I felt with Lena 

304
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,141
you said something about a pawnshop

305
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:34,028
yes there's one 100 metres south of here 

306
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,350
I think it's called Roy's Nest or something 

307
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,600
if I'm not mistaken it should be open late  

308
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:43,400
items that can be pawned at Bird's Nest Roy's appear in your inventory 

309
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,192
under the items tab 

310
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,966
you can pawn these items when talking to Roy

311
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,875
thanks I appreciate your help 

312
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,400
the lieutenant nods as you take the spinners

313
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,100
thank you Kim

314
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,466
see like

315
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:04,953
here's another thing guys you know  

316
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,700
the game has like such a compelling way of telling a story 

317
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,448
and I want to engage with that as much as possible 

318
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:17,262
and for me I would have found it less compelling  

319
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:23,350
to follow the initial impression that a esprit de corps gave me  

320
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,766
that like we're immediately buddies

321
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,596
I think it is so much more interesting to know that 

322
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:32,138
we struggled to reach a point of understanding with each other  

323
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:37,673
that there are ignorances and prejudices and

324
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:41,796
stupid impulsive behaviors that I have chased  

325
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:45,866
that Kim has not abandoned me by the end of the day

326
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,341
and that the final act he's making for me is to like 

327
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:50,240
give me somewhere to rest  

328
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,200
the fact that I have put him through all of this and that he has seen me  

329
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,250
try to show bravado by 

330
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,307
like how fucking pathetic is it that my character 

331
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:06,193
is so desperate to feel okay about himself 

332
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:10,533
that he was like trying to show his authority to a child to Cuno 

333
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,324
what does that tell you about how broken I am as a person  

334
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:18,907
and that since then I have been looking for more sufficient outlets 

335
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:20,259
healthier ones

336
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,972
 because I realized in that moment how pathetic that is 

337
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:28,666
not only did I not succeed in making Cuno think that I was cool

338
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,166
but I also showed a side of myself that is not the one I want Kim to hold on to

339
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,650
and so I have tried different things 

340
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:42,300
you know I revaluated my sense of authority  

341
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,575
I actually went back to Garte even after giving him the slip 

342
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:50,082
to make good on what I owe him 

343
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:55,950
and to look for earnest alternative means to provide him 

344
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,000
with what I what he justly deserves 

345
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:02,800
I have tried displays of violence

346
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,333
displays of intellectual power plays 

347
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,200
and I've also chased you know

348
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,125
narcotic impulses 

349
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,551
and throughout that Kim has not abandoned me 

350
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:23,725
and in fact he has only shown me more empathy  

351
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,750
it started when I failed to catch the coin toss 

352
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,900
and he just picked it up and gave it back to me

353
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:35,990
and it leads me here to giving up something that 

354
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,082
has the potential to make his world the slightest bit more enjoyable  

355
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:46,133
and that he's willing to trade that for

356
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,100
my personal security 

357
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:53,734
that is a show of genuine compassion  

358
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:58,363
and it is something that my character desperately resonates with right now  

359
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:01,692
I am so glad to have fought for these things though 

360
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:05,225
than to just like yes we're best friends from the beginning  

361
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,766
I think that's just not as interesting as a narrative

362
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,400
do you have other psychologists on discord as well  

363
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,166
uh yes

364
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,100
my good friend uh Edgar  

365
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,400
is on the channel psychiatrists he's also on twitch

366
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,250
you should go check him out he's on Twitch and YouTube psyculturists 

367
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:32,266
I'm gonna link it

368
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,133
surprisingly he's not live right now

369
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,066
here is his channel

370
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,600
on your discord well

371
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,500
psychiatrists is on my discord

372
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:14,166
oh he's been sick dang

373
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,200
psychiatrists aka Ed is my in real life Kim

374
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,300
legitimately

375
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,750
let's do this 

376
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,947
let's go pawn this thing we'll do our debrief 

377
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:41,659
and I think that's where we'll end the stream 

378
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:43,896
because that's a nice little narrative tie up 

379
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,666
and then we have completed our first day

380
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:53,466
so I think he said goes south of here correct

381
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:01,100
this is weird because I thought I had a map of the city at first 

382
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,933
and then now I don't have one

383
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:06,700
kind of odd

384
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,333
well let's just investigate 

385
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,166
there we go in here that way down the road

386
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,933
got some trash

387
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:43,800
I don't

388
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,766
door I saw what door

389
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,666
oh this one okay

390
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:53,925
let's check out that trash first what do we got  

391
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,500
fingerless gloves come in handy

392
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,071
let's inspect this

393
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:03,200
 make sure it's safe

394
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,600
okay let's go in

395
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:12,166
what do we got

396
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,866
some kind of machine cash register okay

397
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,966
mostly military wear

398
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,600
a bust of a woman the plaque simply says DEI

399
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,933
in the dark a film projector is whirring away

400
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,419
you see rows of toy soldiers 

401
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,964
guarding the rest of the trinkets displayed on the table 

402
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:45,992
some on horseback others in rags  

403
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:48,900
others yet in bright blue uniforms 

404
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,804
all are stern and unyielding in their duty 

405
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:56,075
try to find something pretty and cool here 

406
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:58,549
then use it to win her back

407
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,975
okay and then empire is coming in with 

408
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:03,535
something kind of contradictory 

409
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:08,079
because it's been pretty avoidant of my past 

410
00:26:08,504 --> 00:26:10,500
but I guess what I'm seeing is

411
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,498
something else 

412
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:21,166
I definitely have some sort of relationship that I feel resentment towards

413
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,206
I'm gonna have to ask it to clarify 

414
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:30,524
yes buy something nice a figurine  

415
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:36,943
big men on big horses clad in lamella armor and carrion flintlocks 

416
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:41,733
the kind that would mow down a line of enemy soldiers in the blink of an eye

417
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,133
frankenigerian knights

418
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,944
I used to be very serious about these guys 

419
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:51,066
a long long time ago

420
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,955
so it seems like this is like

421
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,360
my intuition about what Kim thinks 

422
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,066
because it's chimed in a lot recently on that 

423
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,766
that's how you understand cop culture

424
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,475
not just Kim but other cops

425
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,418
so cop shivers that makes sense 

426
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:24,969
let's check out the uniforms

427
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:29,800
they‘re not all blue these figurines also wear gold coats and caps

428
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,954
complimented by orange trousers 

429
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:36,766
they are variously posed wielding swords and rifles with bayonets

430
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:40,039
wait this looks like a Rene

431
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,266
the old guy who was playing petanque

432
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,933
let's just ask a question

433
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,139
which ones 

434
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:51,760
ah those yes they are  

435
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:54,427
I find the paint job a bit gaudy

436
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:58,400
but children like the bright colors indiscriminately

437
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,333
inspect the figurine

438
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,492
this set of soldiers isn't meant to look impressive 

439
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:08,000
a few have rifles but most of them carry pistols

440
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:11,266
some even shovels and tall sticks

441
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:13,600
are these even soldiers

442
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,133
you're probably talking about the revolutionaries yes

443
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,388
yes--they are soldiers revolutionary soldiers 

444
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:25,292
I think their poverty has been exaggerated for effect 

445
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:27,800
when you place them next to the royalist

446
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,566
it doesn't seem like they could possibly win

447
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,166
these replies

448
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,100
I don't know I'm not really understanding

449
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,966
what this is talking about

450
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,910
you're probably talking about the revolutionaries 

451
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,653
they are soldiers 

452
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:11,133
their podger poverty has been exaggerated for effect

453
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:16,733
so I don't know is he suggesting they're like propaganda or something

454
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,142
okay yeah I must be like 

455
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:27,300
again guys sometimes I'm just gonna like choose responses and

456
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,262
I don't know 

457
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:32,875
sometimes I just choose them 

458
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,500
and I'm not really thinking about like what they mean that much

459
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:43,100
I like that it gives me this option I respect this

460
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,875
I can't comment I don't know what this is supposed to rip 

461
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,200
I don't like either set very much to be honest

462
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:55,190
but there are many parents among my customers 

463
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,601
when you get four options they're usually the different systems  

464
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:00,900
that's what I mean I'm like this is so out of my depth 

465
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,900
this kind of stuff like I

466
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,177
just want to talk about like 

467
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,925
people and feelings and emotions and 

468
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:12,066
man when I wade into any sort of like other subjects

469
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,966
I reveal myself to be a fool in them

470
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:23,970
he seems to have his own take on the conflict played out in perpetuity by these toys 

471
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:26,875
might be interesting to find out what it is

472
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,500
let's do this try to find something cool

473
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,200
everything you pick out seems

474
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,091
faded chipped and sad somehow 

475
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,700
most of them are just broken toys

476
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,550
okay maybe we can try again some other time 

477
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:44,666
any the anime figs yeah that'd be great 

478
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,157
what's this

479
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:48,302
we're getting reports of

480
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:53,517
 *normal* *reasonable* *temperate* political opinions  

481
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,197
somewhere in Martinaise…

482
00:30:55,197 --> 00:30:57,562
I don't want to engage with this 

483
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:01,197
I'm sorry I know that this game is political 

484
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:04,284
I don't want to

485
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,100
it's like legitimately terrifies me I do not want to talk about this stuff

486
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:19,066
must have been a false alarm then

487
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,900
not not engaging with it no

488
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm not interested 

489
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,700
it's like half the game

490
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,420
please understand that this is not an exhaustive like 

491
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,600
commentary on this game or

492
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,600
like I'm not analyzing everything

493
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:51,116
you know like I just want... just don't want to do that

494
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,733
I'm just a therapist

495
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,328
I'm not able to like give smart commentary on that stuff

496
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:03,365
I know that there's a line that crosses over with like

497
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,066
my character is

498
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:10,086
developing a sense of himself

499
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:13,695
and like maybe a political ideology aligns with that

500
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:15,300
but like I find him

501
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,625
you know much like myself like

502
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,377
I am ignorant of these things 

503
00:32:21,377 --> 00:32:24,600
and what they brought or what the broader things represent

504
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,105
so like me

505
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:31,945
my fear is that like I end up pursuing a political path

506
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:35,100
that I find at the end I totally don't align with

507
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:39,133
I don't know if I'm a centrist

508
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:40,666
I genuinely don't know

509
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:46,680
you know I spend my days talking to people about their feelings

510
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:50,000
I do not engage with this stuff in real life

511
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:55,900
it makes me like it's too heavy for me in that area

512
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,166
I just centrist

513
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:09,615
look if this is not the playthrough for you I understand

514
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:14,266
whoever is out there watching this that really wants the hardcore political stuff

515
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,766
I'm just a therapy guy

516
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:25,800
sorry I look I am sorry I really am the sorry cop

517
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,900
how do I FEEL about politics

518
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,333
they make me anxious

519
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:34,166
do you want me to do this

520
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,566
do you want me to do this

521
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:38,533
okay do you want me to fucking do this right now

522
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:45,100
my behavior is deflecting

523
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,533
it's avoiding

524
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
it's minimizing

525
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,900
it's rejecting

526
00:33:58,066 --> 00:33:59,933
uh it's apologizing

527
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,900
it's explaining

528
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,391
it's intellectualizing yeah

529
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't know what else what am I doing right now

530
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:30,666
I'm hiding

531
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm um

532
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm pretending

533
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:43,300
I am

534
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,800
yeah apologizing

535
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,533
I'm doing a lot of this stuff okay

536
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,366
and what am I feeling

537
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm feeling anxious

538
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:59,133
I'm feeling

539
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,258
fear

540
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,900
I'm feeling

541
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:08,833
like

542
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:14,066
inadequate to comment on this

543
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:23,300
I'm feeling I don't know like shame shame for not knowing it 

544
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,666
yes I'm feeling well resistance is the behavior yeah 

545
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,733
sure I'm feeling like

546
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm feeling in some ways tired like

547
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,100
I'm tired of

548
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:46,000
like not knowing this

549
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,335
and like the thoughts that I'm having are like

550
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,733
I don't want to talk about this

551
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,020
this isn't what I know

552
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,425
they're gonna think I'm stupid

553
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,925
I'm gonna say something wrong

554
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,150
you know I'm gonna offend someone

555
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,980
someone's gonna stop watching because It's not interesting

556
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,700
I'm not interesting

557
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,300
I wish I was more interesting like

558
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,766
how does it make me feel

559
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:24,500
it makes me feel bad it makes me feel stupid

560
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:31,438
but like guys I just don't want to fucking talk about politics

561
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:33,116
I don't know anything about it

562
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,140
let me distract you with my knowledge of therapy

563
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:43,800
what else can I do

564
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,200
am I turning into Kim a little bit

565
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:08,240
I just said no to the no politics politic option 

566
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,206
look you know I have gotten rather comfortable with the phrase like

567
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:17,133
I don't know enough about that to have a strong opinion on it

568
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:24,673
maybe that's like I don't know week or something  

569
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:27,100
like someone out there is saying well why don't you just learn

570
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:30,100
why don't you take an investment in learning

571
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,800
like I mean sure it'd be cool to understand this stuff but like

572
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,725
I don't know

573
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:39,675
the only thing I see resulting in like

574
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,055
if I were to pick a political system

575
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,733
and only for the sake of feeling less inadequate

576
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:48,866
what am I doing

577
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:54,846
I'm like diving deeper into an ideology just to avoid a feeling of inadequacy

578
00:37:54,846 --> 00:37:58,500
and I immediately alienate anyone who does not subscribe to that identity

579
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,225
so yes maybe I want to be centrist

580
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:04,865
because I feel like picking an ideology just makes me...

581
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,510
it's just given me a false sense of inclusion

582
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,966
and maybe like I am not so inadequate

583
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,370
but I know what it results in

584
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,140
it results in like animosity from everyone else

585
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,566
it results in like how could you think like that

586
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:19,733
that's stupid

587
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,281
I don't want to get into that of that

588
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:26,400
like I'm a helping profession that's what therapy is

589
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,700
political discussion is like

590
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,020
it's all combative to me

591
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,366
I'm not interested in it

592
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,666
(chat)we'll try this session at another time yeah

593
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:48,333
what did I tell you what did I tell you at the very beginning 

594
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,500
this is one part livestream one part self therapy 

595
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,549
and I have already earnestly reflected on

596
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:03,194
many of my own unknown internal biases

597
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,950
and

598
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:09,800
it been very displeased with some of the discoveries

599
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,600
but that's why you know

600
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,165
it's important to be open about this stuff 

601
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:16,725
like I will just be honest with you and tell you that

602
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:20,966
you know talking about politics makes me feel really shitty

603
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:22,640
because I don't know that much about it

604
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,625
and I will embarrass myself if I talk about them

605
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:28,822
and I already have like a huge insecurity about like

606
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:31,300
being an impostor

607
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,500
you could just role play as a certain ideology 

608
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,380
it does not need to be based on your personal opinion well

609
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:44,390
well I'm already having kind of a hard time like

610
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,940
getting across that a lot of the decisions

611
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,635
I'm making are just role play and not personal

612
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:53,466
but I don't know it's tricky waters to wait into

613
00:39:55,591 --> 00:40:00,455
typical Martinaise streetlight sits among assorted floor and table lamps

614
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:03,733
you got me in the anxiety goldilocks it's true 

615
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:16,466
street light is that a street light

616
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:17,566
yes officer

617
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:20,800
as you see it's in perfect working order

618
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,735
let's let our gaze run over

619
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:25,400
the light pole has been carefully cut

620
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,875
and the wiring has been redone and attached to a standard indoor plug

621
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,649
the light buses fakely but persistently 

622
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,430
it was brought to me to be altered

623
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,850
we are not here to investigate the theft of city property

624
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:46,666
you have to admit it's rather clever what he's done with it

625
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,766
I mean it's kind of cool I'm not gonna say it's not cool 

626
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,550
but we don't need it right now let's talk to him 

627
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,422
if you don't mind please put the flashlight away  

628
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:06,258
some of us have photonic sensitivities

629
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:11,416
oh my god he actually responded to me having the flashlight out

630
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:15,700
I love that 

631
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,500
I was I was rather like expecting it to come up in

632
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:26,166
he's actually like waving his arms around as well

633
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,300
I was hoping it would come up in the in a scene

634
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,041
where I'm like interrogating someone

635
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:31,741
I mean that's kind of what I'm doing right now

636
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:33,200
what have you got to hide

637
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:35,945
no this is my thing

638
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:39,066
how can the game know that I've been doing this the whole time 

639
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:41,180
okay sorry

640
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,791
I do appreciate it

641
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:44,933
we're sorry cop

642
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,820
not above apologizing

643
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,375
let's put the flashlight away

644
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:57,195
we have enough self awareness to know that it is off putting 

645
00:41:57,195 --> 00:42:00,109
and we have no reason to be

646
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:02,566
confrontation with this gentleman

647
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:07,133
it's not often that I see officers from the RCM in my pawnshop

648
00:42:09,983 --> 00:42:13,800
I do really hope you don't just disregard the political stuff 

649
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,670
in this game though

650
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,695
because it ties together with psychological issues

651
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:19,766
and character flaws with a political ideology

652
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,460
it corresponds with both the player and the other characters

653
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,438
you'll get an incomplete picture if you don't

654
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,945
at least take it into account 

655
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,275
I just don't really agree

656
00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:35,966
I have never once ever in my life as a therapist in any session 

657
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:38,255
ever in real life and real practice

658
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,915
come to the conclusion

659
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:41,882
that the way someone feels about something 

660
00:42:41,882 --> 00:42:44,708
is a result of their political ideology

661
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:49,755
never that has never like I have never been in that kind of dialogue

662
00:42:49,755 --> 00:42:53,900
where someone's like yeah you know I feel really bad

663
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,183
when

664
00:42:58,783 --> 00:43:00,933
when I'm talking to my friends

665
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:03,985
I hope that they listen to me

666
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:05,985
but when they start talking I kind of tune out you know 

667
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:07,700
and they feel really bad about that

668
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:14,885
like where would I pull out the idea that

669
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:19,000
how does this make you not a communist 

670
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,333
you know like

671
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:28,855
it's never happened

672
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:30,245
and even when I'm talking about

673
00:43:30,245 --> 00:43:33,000
like those things that I talked about the social determinants

674
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:38,566
that is the extent I will talk about politics okay

675
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:41,278
and this is my task for you okay

676
00:43:41,278 --> 00:43:42,566
this is homework

677
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:45,600
for chat and YouTube

678
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:49,469
you decide what political system I have

679
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:51,750
because I don't know what I would call it

680
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,600
but like

681
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:57,666
social determinants of health SDOH

682
00:43:57,933 --> 00:44:03,977
they are anything non medical that has an influence on... 

683
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:08,125
mental health okay so like

684
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,800
there is a genetic component to mental health

685
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,560
there is a genetic component to certain disorders

686
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,625
there is a genetic component to addiction

687
00:44:21,183 --> 00:44:23,516
there are

688
00:44:25,508 --> 00:44:27,475
developmental things to consider

689
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:29,050
was there any substance use

690
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,675
while the individual's parents were pregnant with them

691
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:34,675
any delayed birth complications

692
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,702
any delayed milestones

693
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:43,066
like walking talking going to the bathroom party training

694
00:44:43,866 --> 00:44:50,733
any delayed milestones in terms of you know development of like

695
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,000
preoperational thought

696
00:44:58,416 --> 00:44:59,950
cognitive things right 

697
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,266
like these are all

698
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,834
medical determinations of health

699
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,125
emotions thoughts behaviors etc 

700
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,987
social determinants of health are for example 

701
00:45:12,987 --> 00:45:13,000
social determinants of health are for example 

702
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,875
like access to health care

703
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,400
access to education

704
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,866
what sort of like resources does a person have to 

705
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,966
become educated about things right

706
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,475
those have an impact on mental health 

707
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:34,900
because if someone does not grow up with access to education

708
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,200
 like let's say Frittte girl okay

709
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:41,050
she is someone who has clearly has the aptitude 

710
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:45,700
for intelligent discourse about things like technology

711
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,333
right like if she had access to education

712
00:45:53,866 --> 00:45:56,272
she would not be stuck in a dead end job

713
00:45:57,222 --> 00:46:01,275
working against tons of the non social determinants of health 

714
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,133
that make her fucking miserable

715
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,000
now could she pay for school on a Frittte salary no

716
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,766
so you know look I lived in

717
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,100
Denmark for a number of years 

718
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,650
and I went there from the United States 

719
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,050
and the things that I encountered there you know as a young 17 year old 

720
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,333
were very interesting to me right

721
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:33,225
like I ended up going to school with people 

722
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:36,991
and I would find that like other 17 year olds had their own apartments

723
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,800
and I was like how does that work and and they would tell me

724
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,579
well you know like the the government's giving me a stipend

725
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:49,841
 because I'm going to school like I'm getting an education so it's like   

726
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,225
they're giving me a stipend to encourage me to continue that education

727
00:46:54,225 --> 00:46:57,100
and I'm not paying for the education the education is free 

728
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,225
and for that reason I'm able to like have my own apartment 

729
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:02,025
and those are social determinants 

730
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:05,275
because I found that these individuals of 17 years old 

731
00:47:05,275 --> 00:47:07,350
were far more independent than myself 

732
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,817
I found that their self-esteem was accelerated  

733
00:47:10,817 --> 00:47:15,366
by having this kind of early freedom and responsibility  

734
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:21,875
and that they were primed to deal with issues like financial management

735
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,666
what are safe boundaries to set with people about having them over

736
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:33,900
how should you regulate your schedule better  

737
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,900
your sleeping your dieting going to school yourself

738
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,157
these are all social determinants 

739
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,710
the government provided them with free education 

740
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,166
they provided them with a means to take care of themselves

741
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,300
and these accelerated virtues 

742
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,300
that I find many adults well past the ages seventeen 

743
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,000
have not had the means to develop in the United States

744
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,300
in fact much of my job is spent

745
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:05,300
working with people who have never had the kind of opportunity 

746
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,016
to develop those very simple foundational life skills 

747
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:11,875
people of thirty years old people of sixty years old

748
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,225
and they have decades of inbuilt shame 

749
00:48:17,225 --> 00:48:19,875
because they don't know how to wash their clothes properly  

750
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,638
they don't know how to cook a healthy meal

751
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:26,050
this has had severe impacts on their mental health 

752
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,500
it has resulted in

753
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:32,800
deeply maladaptive behaviors like 

754
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,775
dependence on substances to cope with inadequacy

755
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,600
homelessness

756
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:43,800
a struggle to maintain healthy relationships 

757
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,725
all of these things right these are social determinants 

758
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:49,325
so yes I have political opinions 

759
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:52,466
and they are informed by real world experiences

760
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:57,550
and they're informed by seeing alternatives to the political system that I live in 

761
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:03,125
 and being shocked and very disheartened by  

762
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,600
how some of those systems wrap around mental health right

763
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:14,225
so like that's the extent of my opinion you know 

764
00:49:15,225 --> 00:49:16,566
people's lives are

765
00:49:18,566 --> 00:49:20,304
affected by these things 

766
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:24,100
but I don't give a fuck what the system is called

767
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:29,666
I don't like I genuinely couldn't distinguish like

768
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:36,516
the ideologies of communism versus free market capitalism like

769
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,300
I don't know capitalism is

770
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,975
I do not have the language to discuss this subject like I 

771
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,550
yes I just want to help people 

772
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,533
and I know that part of that job is being informed about how 

773
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,325
at the top of the chain a political system influences mental health 

774
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:59,558
I feel like I've demonstrated I am aware of these things

775
00:50:00,366 --> 00:50:03,625
but again they just don't come up in my work 

776
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:08,250
for the person who does not know how to wash their clothes at age sixty 

777
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,666
I am not working with them on like

778
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:15,900
so how should we change your ideological opinions to change the political system

779
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,100
that's what social workers do right

780
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,666
social workers are people who are a lot more involved in that kind of advocacy 

781
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,575
I treat the behavioral symptoms 

782
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:27,850
and I treat the emotional outcomes

783
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,466
which are informed by a

784
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:39,641
distant understanding of political systems

785
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,900
so

786
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,766
yeah like look I this is why

787
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:53,432
this is why I like didn't want to talk about it because

788
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:59,025
it like it makes me it

789
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,425
I don't find that the discussions it stimulates are really what I'm after  

790
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:09,625
when I'm talking about psychology  

791
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,800
when I'm talking about psychology

792
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:18,271
my interest is in showing people interesting ways to think about their own lives and 

793
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:24,000
maybe learning a technique or two to improve their day to day you know

794
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,550
I just don't have the the goal of like 

795
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,375
pushing narratives forward about bigger ideas like that 

796
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,800
like that's for someone else 

797
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,800
that's for someone else who is more equipped more of research more studied 

798
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,975
I've compiled my personal experiences into like a framework  

799
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,366
that helps me do my job for a certain kind of person

800
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:49,300
but I don't have the

801
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,266
capability or interest really in like

802
00:51:56,166 --> 00:52:00,125
developing that narrative here on this space 

803
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,800
I hope that explains where I'm coming from

804
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,733
I don't know if it does

805
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:10,366
but yeah hopefully it does a little bit

806
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,000
I know there's a lot of comments here

807
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:20,466
so don't get mad at me if I um

808
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:24,300
don't engage with the political side of this game

809
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,750
I have my reasons and they're just not really what I'm trying to do with this platform 

810
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,950
this is a therapy show 

811
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,600
that's why I find fun I don't find politics fun 

812
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,691
I find them to be grounds for arguments

813
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:40,933
or even if not arguments just like

814
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:44,341
disagreement

815
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,700
I'm misunderstanding the game's angle

816
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,833
okay well

817
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:53,566
I don't care

818
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,566
I don't care like I'm gonna play it

819
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,508
how I want to and can you know

820
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,375
I think you're going to be fine generally 

821
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,946
the political stuff that's relevant to the personal analysis

822
00:53:11,946 --> 00:53:13,930
 tends to be how your personal issues and beliefs

823
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:17,133
 can affect your political and world beliefs well 

824
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,341
like at the risk of going on another tangent 

825
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,575
schemas are you know 

826
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,053
another way I might formulate the ideas around core beliefs  

827
00:53:26,425 --> 00:53:29,600
and some of them are uh you know we have schemas about the self

828
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,050
 about other people and about the world

829
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,566
 and that's where those would come into play right

830
00:53:33,566 --> 00:53:35,510
like one of my schemas about the world

831
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,000
 is that education should be free

832
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:42,100
I don't give a fuck what political system that makes me 

833
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,775
it's just a fundamental belief I have based on the absolute tragedy 

834
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:48,525
that I have personally witnessed and deal with every day 

835
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,333
of people who have had not had access to that means 

836
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:55,071
and I see no justifiable economic reason 

837
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,166
in the United States

838
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,866
for that not to be a reality

839
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,175
and as I have said that 

840
00:54:02,175 --> 00:54:06,200
I have probably lost a portion of the audience who thinks I'm a fucking idiot

841
00:54:07,866 --> 00:54:10,225
uh because that's just not how the economy works 

842
00:54:10,225 --> 00:54:12,875
but that's why I don't fucking talk about this 

843
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,300
because that's just not what I'm interested in and I don't care okay

844
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:21,050
I'm gonna continue playing the game because I'm gonna like I don't know

845
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,666
it's just not benefiting me

846
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,766
what can I do for you

847
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,625
this courtesy is not insincere but he prefers being alone with his projector 

848
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:34,000
this courtesy is not insincere but he prefers being alone with his projector 

849
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,966
just watching the movement of light across the walls of the show

850
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:46,575
I am very interested in the fact that he's in this dimly lit room 

851
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:50,075
his pupils are very dilated most likely 

852
00:54:50,075 --> 00:54:52,166
because that's what happens when you're in a dark room

853
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:54,450
your peoples dilate to capture more light 

854
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,425
and here I came in like with my fucking flashlight 

855
00:54:57,425 --> 00:55:00,050
and it he responded to that 

856
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,325
they fucking thought of everything 

857
00:55:02,475 --> 00:55:04,933
sorry I feel like I'm interrupting you sorry cop

858
00:55:07,066 --> 00:55:08,366
let's ask him if he had any trouble lately

859
00:55:08,366 --> 00:55:10,933
I haven't had any problems myself

860
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,027
though some of my customers have complained 

861
00:55:13,027 --> 00:55:15,966
about inconsistent law enforcement

862
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:19,050
who are your customers usually 

863
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,212
good question Kim  

864
00:55:20,212 --> 00:55:23,200
all kinds of people come through here 

865
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,350
locals travelers people looking for a deal  

866
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:30,025
people looking for a keepsake 

867
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:32,858
people who are terminally bored

868
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:36,900
interesting perspective friend

869
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,450
as you can see 

870
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,866
I have a wide selection of goods for everyone to choose from

871
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,425
look around typical vacuous consumers objects 

872
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:49,625
see like that's

873
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,375
I'm just gonna follow the game here 

874
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,825
quite the collection I *may* have something to add to it

875
00:55:55,825 --> 00:55:58,750
it keeps me entertained

876
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,500
as attention is drawn once more 

877
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,400
to the play of light and shadow on the walls behind you

878
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,550
entertained he might be high

879
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:08,700
 if he is on what

880
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,900
hmm

881
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,566
I guess there's no harm in asking

882
00:56:21,066 --> 00:56:24,525
okay he definitely *is* high 

883
00:56:24,525 --> 00:56:28,500
whatever it is you've probably done it and many other things besides   

884
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:33,200
I can't cut through the jumble of sensations to get to the answer 

885
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,166
a guarded man like him wouldn't tell you if you asked out loud

886
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:38,933
okay

887
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,200
that's fine let's not judge

888
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,875
let's ask him if he carries any weapons 

889
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,733
maybe mine has passed through these parts

890
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:52,733
someone else came here earlier today asking the same question

891
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,500
I promptly sold her the gun you pawned a couple days back

892
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,933
I pawned my own gun shit

893
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:02,200
what *sold*

894
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,400
the lieutenant shifts from one foot to another alert

895
00:57:05,466 --> 00:57:09,050
I fucking told you guys that I 

896
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,550
i'm pretty sure I claimed much earlier that 

897
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,600
I wanted to stop being a cop before this

898
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,150
and that I may have done something purposefully 

899
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:21,166
to remove myself of the burden of my own memories

900
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:29,700
let's investigate that

901
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:34,375
you are

902
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,750
you were adamant about getting rid of it officer  

903
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:44,200
said you were undeserving of a service weapon of the Revachol citizens militia

904
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,266
I knew it fucking knew it

905
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,675
and I don't like keeping guns around the shop for long 

906
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:55,650
off-the-charts photon emissions the unhealthy kind  

907
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:59,733
this does expand my view of the character because

908
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:03,566
consider it like this

909
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,625
the person I was before was not in the possession

910
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:11,675
of the kind of virtues that we are developing now 

911
00:58:11,675 --> 00:58:17,175
virtues of an interest in self discovery and apology  

912
00:58:17,175 --> 00:58:24,050
of connecting to people of responding to gratitude and empathy  

913
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,875
like with Lena and Kim so far 

914
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:29,300
my character may not have felt that he was deserving 

915
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,866
or even capable of being a cop

916
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:33,600
because without possession of those virtues

917
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,300
he could not stop himself from taking advantage of his authority

918
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,366
which again would fit into the ideology of like everything is authority

919
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:46,350
but we are starting to like ourselves a little bit more 

920
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:50,725
we are starting to find there is virtue and apology and connecting to others 

921
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:56,200
and we are building upon ourselves 

922
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,483
a small tower of helpful core beliefs

923
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:08,100
and so we may feel slightly more comfortable being in the role of 

924
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:13,166
someone who can help others and provide some kind of structure to the world

925
00:59:14,433 --> 00:59:17,600
this is fascinating to me I love everything about this

926
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:24,450
he's not telling you the whole story it seems he's trying to spare you 

927
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,375
I want to know more though tell me the whole thing 

928
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:30,266
you weren't quiet yourself officer 

929
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:31,800
what was I like

930
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,975
you were very distraught

931
00:59:33,975 --> 00:59:37,325
you said the gun was a threat to your life and 

932
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:40,825
that you can't *trust* yourself with it tonight 

933
00:59:40,825 --> 00:59:42,933
and that you need the money

934
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:45,541
man that's fucking sad

935
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,733
it's sad but also so

936
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:55,450
if I am working with someone who discovered this about themselves 

937
00:59:55,450 --> 01:00:02,200
their instinct maybe to feel like just as I did like that's really sad you know

938
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,360
but a meaningful interpretation of this 

939
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,490
could not leave out the fact that

940
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:21,260
even when he was indisposed of his own self empathy and

941
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:29,750
was fearful of you know not being able to like be safe

942
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,700
like he's a danger to himself or others

943
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,830
there was a

944
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:39,500
there was something in there that made a good decision

945
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,860
right it's resulted in a lot of problems but

946
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:45,230
like there was a self preservation instinct of

947
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,660
you were trying to protect your own life

948
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,730
there was something you cared about it

949
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,330
that you didn't trust that

950
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,260
if you pushed any further into that depression

951
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,160
that you would have gone too far

952
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,460
like there is something about self empathy there

953
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,460
when I said that I don't normally buy firearms

954
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,300
you put the gun barrel in your mouth and sort of sucked on it 

955
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,330
then I agreed to take it

956
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,830
yeah that's heartbreaking 

957
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:22,100
you sucked on a gun good 

958
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,560
very normal

959
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:29,830
I'm so sorry you had to see me in that state

960
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,730
we don't have to talk about it any further

961
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,300
look how much empathy I'm displaying here to see that

962
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,300
not only this is exactly what I meant about

963
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,530
the apology not being purely transactional

964
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,760
and why it's a good thing that he is apologetic here

965
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,160
he is not looking for forgiveness he is genuinely sorry 

966
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,260
not just for the way this makes him feel but he is telling 

967
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,630
he is able to tell how

968
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:05,310
upset it made Roy as well

969
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,530
like that it was not fair to him

970
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,490
in a very displacement sort of way

971
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:15,130
I brought to you emotions that you were not deserving of

972
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,230
empathy towards himself and to Roy

973
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,500
we don't have to talk about it anymore

974
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,830
that statement is not for us

975
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:23,930
it's for Roy

976
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:26,260
like we can tell this is making him uncomfortable

977
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,300
and we're also burdening him

978
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,125
like we don't want him to feel pressured to tell us

979
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,160
about the horrible state we were in

980
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,260
you know

981
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,100
if I witnessed a close friend do something

982
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,930
that I knew they were going to regret

983
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,500
you can bet that while I'm telling them I'm gonna try to soften up like

984
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,260
yeah you really did that

985
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,360
you know

986
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,630
because I don't want to harm their own self image

987
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,670
it's a hard thing to do and

988
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:01,860
our guy is invested in Roy not developing that same thing

989
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,130
like this is really human to say this

990
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,530
no apologies necessary officer

991
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,860
was the buyer a policeman too

992
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:15,260
she didn't seem like a policeman

993
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,060
although she kept referring to herself as a Pig

994
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,630
which was odd

995
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,900
I found her interest in the gun a bit

996
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:29,060
obsessive but I was just happy to get rid of it

997
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,730
and of her

998
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,530
truth be told she was terrifying

999
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,760
right so let me get this right

1000
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,330
you sold your sidearm issued by the citizens militia

1001
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,100
and now a civilian is running around the streets of Martinaise with it

1002
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,130
miraculously

1003
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,560
his face does not reveal what's happening inside

1004
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,700
I'm so glad I have empathy as a trait here 

1005
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,830
there's only one explanation she must be one of my rabid fans

1006
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,230
maybe she's a vigilante

1007
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,500
I don't like it either

1008
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,300
I'm sorry I'm sorry I sold my dad

1009
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:09,630
yeah it's not good

1010
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,730
I do hope we manage to clean this mess up somehow

1011
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,730
while also keeping our focus on the murder investigation

1012
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:20,530
this mess he means your mess

1013
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,160
man

1014
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,030
any idea where I can find this buyer

1015
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,830
my apologies officer

1016
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:32,100
but I have no idea where she was coming from

1017
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,860
or where she went

1018
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,130
a needle in a haystack

1019
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,130
there is nothing you can do about it right now

1020
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,760
you'll just have to hope Evrart wasn't lying

1021
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,700
and the union can track her down in time

1022
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,930
let's ask him about Evrart

1023
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,160
maybe shady looking guys came in here yesterday

1024
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:59,350
looking like they're just taken off their Wild Pines overalls

1025
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,060
they asked if I have a police weapon to sell

1026
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,900
I told them I already sold it

1027
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,560
so those guys have no fucking clue where my gun is those liars 

1028
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,630
they went their way it was a trip 

1029
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:12,930
but you know

1030
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,960
all sorts of people come here

1031
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,930
asking for all sorts of things

1032
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,500
maybe Claire really is tracking down your gun

1033
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,130
at least now I know how I lost my sidearm

1034
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,500
let's talk about something else

1035
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:31,130
um

1036
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,949
you might be able to investigation

1037
01:05:35,949 --> 01:05:39,500
I doubt it But I can try and answer any questions you may have

1038
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,060
know anything about the hanging

1039
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,900
I do my best to keep my distance from all manner of butchery

1040
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,760
bad for business bad for everyone

1041
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,060
I like a good neutral stance

1042
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,160
no one likes to see what you have to see every day

1043
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,930
no no they don't okay

1044
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,430
the pawnbroker's gaze is already fixed on the dancing colors

1045
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,360
there's something I'd like to sell

1046
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,060
we'd like to sell these hubcaps

1047
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,230
yeah we actually did talk to Claire already

1048
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:19,030
Roy takes the hubcaps from the Lieutenant and inspects them

1049
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:24,060
the spinners appear iridescent in the dancing light of his pawnshop

1050
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,860
yes these are very very good

1051
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,530
did you defraud some foreign prints for them

1052
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,760
jumper mesque banger

1053
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:38,130
no matter I'll give you 200 real

1054
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,930
Fucking finally we got some cash and we can have a good sleep

1055
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:45,300
no one was defrauded or gent I assure you

1056
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,087
the lieutenant explains

1057
01:06:49,087 --> 01:06:51,500
 as the pawnbroker opens the register and counts the cash

1058
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,430
of course I meant no offense

1059
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:57,460
200 real for you officer

1060
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,930
delight for doing business with you do come again 

1061
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:02,860
thank you

1062
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:07,660
here is the 100 real you need for your bill do not waste it 

1063
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,560
the windfall is a small consolation

1064
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,860
anything else you're thinking of selling

1065
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:19,416
uh I don't think I have anything else to sale

1066
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:21,150
another time perhaps

1067
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:22,630
okay let's leave

1068
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,300
all right let's go to bed 

1069
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,260
and we'll debrief with Kim and then

1070
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,630
we will call it an evening

1071
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:39,160
and that'll be our nice little narrative wrap up for the time

1072
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,660
my cat is also demanding my attention

1073
01:07:48,509 --> 01:07:49,015
what 

1074
01:07:49,015 --> 01:07:53,560
all around you rain falls on the great city of Revachol

1075
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:57,060
rain drips from the eaves and floods the gutters

1076
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,560
washing the filth away

1077
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:03,230
the spring Thor must be here the snow is melting 

1078
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,160
looking up at the sky cold water dripping from your hat 

1079
01:08:10,282 --> 01:08:11,230
what do I see

1080
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,660
grey sky like great battleships

1081
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,760
clouds colliding with one another

1082
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,730
rain falls down on the world

1083
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,230
how does it feel

1084
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:23,230
humid your coat shields you from the rain

1085
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:25,530
while the city shivers around you

1086
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,330
what's in the west

1087
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,430
sheets of rain over the water

1088
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:34,900
a flight of stairs leading into the ocean

1089
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:38,830
wave after wave washing the coast of Martinaise

1090
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,700
with its motorboats and gently swaying reeds

1091
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,430
the ruins of a half sunken sea fort

1092
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,115
crumble on an inlet 

1093
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:51,160
beyond the bay of Revachol ghosts rise into the sky 

1094
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,560
shivers as prose as like

1095
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,030
like a sweet dessert

1096
01:08:58,739 --> 01:08:59,442
who are you ghost

1097
01:08:59,442 --> 01:09:02,930
the skyscrapers of LA Delta the financial district 

1098
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:06,900
faint golden light seeps from the office windows

1099
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,460
will you ever go there

1100
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:10,860
will I

1101
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:13,802
no you are just one of the hundreds of thousands

1102
01:09:13,802 --> 01:09:17,860
 who watch them rise across the bay from Martinaise every day 

1103
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,660
urban coastline

1104
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,900
rain drip it off Etonite covered roofs

1105
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,530
cinderblocks left over from half finished construction

1106
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:31,015
a defunct research and development building 

1107
01:09:31,015 --> 01:09:32,960
once seized by revolutionaries 

1108
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:37,360
an old wooden church stands on stilts above the water

1109
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:39,560
and beyond that

1110
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,700
Coal City end of all lines

1111
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:45,700
run your fingers through your dampened hair

1112
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,560
your hair is an oily mess

1113
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,630
flecked with ash from neighboring coal plants

1114
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,830
smoke stacks rise somewhere in the distance

1115
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,160
God's beautiful

1116
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,030
what's in the east

1117
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:00,630
the great gates of the industrial harbor are locked

1118
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,060
a chill runs down your back

1119
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,900
you shatter like an animal trying to shake water from its side

1120
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,900
shake them again

1121
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,830
his trauma lives in the body

1122
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,360
um

1123
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:22,030
sometimes you can see people who have experienced lots of trauma

1124
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,430
have a certain kind of shiver to them

1125
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,730
like their body is

1126
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,030
still in a perpetual reaction to a car accident

1127
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,240
and

1128
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,870
some therapeutic styles are very much about learning to

1129
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,040
release some of that tension

1130
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,570
it's powerful to see

1131
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:50,060
let's shake those shoulders

1132
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,500
you shudder looking down at your feet

1133
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:56,500
dirty rainwater runs veins into the plaza snow

1134
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,960
two green snakeskin shoes stand at attention

1135
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,730
of the mosaic paving of the plaza

1136
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,460
Cape side apartments

1137
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:08,660
tower blocks crowd one another

1138
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:14,760
4.46 millimeter bullets still lodged in their war torn stone walls 

1139
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:19,430
hallways collapsed from the mortar hits of a war that was lost long ago

1140
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:22,675
clotheslines go to waste in the rain 

1141
01:11:22,675 --> 01:11:23,960
radios play

1142
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,731
and closer to here

1143
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:28,930
a yard rain falls onto the roof of a woodshed

1144
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:34,130
the lingering odour of decomposition mixes with that of damp soil 

1145
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,630
what's in the south

1146
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:36,560
a traffic jam

1147
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,960
rain thrumming on the roofs of motor vehicles

1148
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:44,660
inside drivers watch water streaming down their windshields 

1149
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,500
the statue of a king shudders he too is cold 

1150
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,530
the canal bridge has been raised

1151
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:52,960
what's on the other side

1152
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:57,730
the road ascends a raised motorway loops above the ghetto 

1153
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,730
beneath its concrete columns a sea of rooftops

1154
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:04,630
woodwork and tar stretches northward

1155
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,630
four story buildings as far as the rain can fall

1156
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,460
the snows melt in Jamrock

1157
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:13,900
why am I not there

1158
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,730
to be in Martinaise where no one goes

1159
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:19,860
at the runoff point of a long forgotten canal

1160
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,860
in the whitest part of town

1161
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:25,130
in the shadow of the day the revolution failed

1162
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,630
God damn that's

1163
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,860
God this writing just hits

1164
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,330
standing in the rain

1165
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,900
looking north where Jamrock Rock City stretches inland

1166
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,260
my God

1167
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:40,850
shudder look further

1168
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,630
in the rain swept distance

1169
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,760
above the rooftops of Jamrock

1170
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:49,830
a repurpose silk mill stands perched above the motorway exit 

1171
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,730
precinct 41 hunches in the rain

1172
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:56,960
your vision blurs you wipe your face with your hand 

1173
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:01,900
the rain stings your eyes making you look up and blink

1174
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:02,919
Whats above

1175
01:13:02,919 --> 01:13:07,500
coalition aerostatics hang like apparitions under the cloud cover

1176
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,160
way up there where rain forms rotors flutter silently

1177
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,260
your sight clears

1178
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:21,030
collapsed storm drains old sewage systems flooded with rain water 

1179
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,530
hidden weapon caches from the revolution

1180
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,160
doors leading down to loroyam

1181
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,360
the catacombs to which for three centuries

1182
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,960
they delivered the blue blooded dead

1183
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,060
motherfucker I love that

1184
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,960
this rain will not let up anytime soon

1185
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:39,530
at least we are dressed for it

1186
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,630
let's keep moving

1187
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:43,930
let's keep moving

1188
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,860
okay let's go in

1189
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,100
let's complete our first day

1190
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,260
we've been through a lot

1191
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:59,160
we've been through so much

1192
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,730
can I help you

1193
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,630
so about that money I owe

1194
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:09,430
yes have you got it

1195
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:10,430
I have it

1196
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,330
here it is sorry for the trouble

1197
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,530
I hope I give

1198
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,900
I hope I have an apology in every dialogue now

1199
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,430
great thank you officer that's all I wanted

1200
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,530
payment for services rendered

1201
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,260
if you continue to stay here

1202
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:35,100
I just ask that you please pay your nightly bill in advance starting tomorrow

1203
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,730
okay he's not sorry about his behavior for your sake

1204
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:40,627
now that you have money 

1205
01:14:40,627 --> 01:14:43,360
he really wants to make sure you're not angry with him 

1206
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:48,130
the electronic lock to your room has been disabled till 9pm tomorrow 

1207
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:52,960
please pray for each night in advance starting tomorrow 

1208
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,860
20 real per night

1209
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:58,460
we can swing that there's enough trash in Martinaise for that 

1210
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,900
I'll take your room here too

1211
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,960
oh Kim 

1212
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:05,130
you want to be roomies

1213
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:09,900
of course always happy to have offices from the RCM as guests 

1214
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:11,730
anything else I can do for you

1215
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,930
so here's the thing I do not want my character to drink 

1216
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,730
but I believe that that would be part of his

1217
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,480
like he's been through so much

1218
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:27,300
and I think that he would still have a hard time 

1219
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,700
not considering a drink a reward at this point right

1220
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,700
a thesis I have been trying to get across is that like

1221
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:44,860
addiction hijacks your rational decision making and it 

1222
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:52,130
we get mixed up in our priority structures and our behaviors and

1223
01:15:52,698 --> 01:15:55,298
just the same way that I was talking about we develop

1224
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,500
like complicated misattributions of emotions with behavior 

1225
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:08,830
our guys still has a strong relationship between relief reward and alcoholism

1226
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:11,530
so we're also going to drink

1227
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:14,660
because that is probably our belief

1228
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,630
do I have a shaker in my hand

1229
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,760
is this is this a shaker

1230
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,860
he sounds irritated

1231
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,880
you sound irritated why all I want is a drink

1232
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,260
am I wearing a little bowtie

1233
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,830
am I wearing a bowtie and doing this

1234
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,700
am I smiling

1235
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,930
do you see me smiling and shaking my little shaker

1236
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,980
I mean I thought he was a bartender

1237
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,000
do you know why

1238
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:45,760
that's right I'm the cafeteria manager

1239
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:49,560
what you want is a goddamn drink

1240
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,360
how is that so hard to understand

1241
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:03,895
you know what the impact of rejection is stronger than 

1242
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:07,730
than the impulse to drink from my guy right now as a sorry cop 

1243
01:17:08,808 --> 01:17:11,930
I I abandon I'm going to abandon the

1244
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,900
the desire to drink because I am

1245
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,260
too ashamed to ask further

1246
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,130
like what

1247
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:19,230
goodbye

1248
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:24,160
oh the bartender quit because of me that's pretty bad

1249
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,830
okay let's go to bed

1250
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:34,460
so how do I do my debrief with Kim

1251
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,430
this is the door to the room you redecorated

1252
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:45,900
just a moment you had some questions earlier I believe 

1253
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,830
and besides we should discuss our progress on the investigation 

1254
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,660
let's go out to the balcony

1255
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:53,560
all right let's go

1256
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:56,830
it's time

1257
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:00,830
we've made it through a day

1258
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:07,730
the lieutenant is silent for a moment he listens to the traffic hum  then 

1259
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:12,060
where shall we begin we should talk about the investigation 

1260
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,430
first and foremost

1261
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,630
but I also remember you wanting to discuss the RCM

1262
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,730
I didn't know you smoked Kim

1263
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,266
I have a cigarette every night 

1264
01:18:21,266 --> 01:18:24,060
when I go over my notes it's something of a ritual

1265
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,530
hmm okay

1266
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:31,160
he looks so devastatingly cool with that cigarette

1267
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:35,560
cigarette is a great idea I think I'm going to have one 

1268
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,930
your call detective

1269
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,660
again I only have exactly one every night

1270
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,960
look we've got to have a smoke with Kim

1271
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,230
okay we

1272
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:52,900
we're starting to develop a solemn relationship with him 

1273
01:18:54,804 --> 01:18:57,500
and in fact I would say that like

1274
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:00,960
maybe seeing that Kim only smokes one cigarette a day

1275
01:19:02,066 --> 01:19:03,500
as we are starting to see him

1276
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,019
as someone who is not only a good cop but is also a good person 

1277
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:13,900
maybe it is possible to live this life be a cop

1278
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:16,300
have good morals make good decisions

1279
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:19,940
have empathy and be disciplined enough

1280
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:22,530
not to chase every impulse that we have

1281
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:26,158
so what better way to connect with him

1282
01:19:26,658 --> 01:19:29,288
the city trembles with its remaining lights

1283
01:19:29,558 --> 01:19:32,958
people are rushing home running away from home 

1284
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:36,900
smoking sleeping singing in the shower 

1285
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:41,645
edges of dining tables hands aprons flicker through windows

1286
01:19:41,645 --> 01:19:43,160
 before the lights go out 

1287
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,300
how did you get so cool Kim

1288
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:49,330
you mean this this isn't cool 

1289
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:53,230
it's an unnecessary trial of will and unhealthy

1290
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,560
keeping the habit within the parameters he's given himself

1291
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,100
takes a lot of focus

1292
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,360
it would be easy to simply quit

1293
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,460
what did I just say

1294
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:07,060
fuckin' volition is speaking my language I knew it

1295
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,730
I knew that it would be like

1296
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,730
a demonstration of discipline to our guy

1297
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,230
right then the debris

1298
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,360
it's been a long an eventful day

1299
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,900
it has we have been through so much

1300
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,600
how do you think today went

1301
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,375
we performed a cursory initial inspection of the victim's body  

1302
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:29,700
then you shot the body down

1303
01:20:30,066 --> 01:20:32,500
which was quite a shot

1304
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,000
it was cool wasn't it Kim

1305
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,975
I was inspired by your confidence in me 

1306
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,133
I think that's that's honest

1307
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:53,733
what is true right now is that I was inspired by kim's confidence

1308
01:20:56,366 --> 01:20:59,292
I admit I wasn't sure whether I should give you the gun

1309
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:00,667
 but I'm glad I did 

1310
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:04,808
your shot enabled us to perform a field autopsy on the victim

1311
01:21:04,808 --> 01:21:07,709
 we found some things we can really work with

1312
01:21:09,466 --> 01:21:11,600
this is the moment that I have been waiting for

1313
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:18,712
I have been waiting to hear his thoughts on all that has transpired

1314
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:22,475
 and to not just give me the report

1315
01:21:22,934 --> 01:21:26,566
 but like to connect to me as a human you know

1316
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,585
and I can see that that's not something Kim finds

1317
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,566
 like the easiest time doing either

1318
01:21:35,366 --> 01:21:37,166
but when he does boy does he

1319
01:21:37,466 --> 01:21:39,650
I still feel like we missed something

1320
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:42,075
 but it's up to the boys in processing now

1321
01:21:42,075 --> 01:21:45,075
 we did perform a thorough search on the crime scene

1322
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:45,800
 that's great

1323
01:21:46,059 --> 01:21:48,575
I would say it was a little too thorough in my case

1324
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:50,460
 now as for interviews

1325
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:53,600
 my list of people to talk to here in Martinaise I mean 

1326
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,200
the initial interviews yes well we talked to some people  

1327
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,025
including Evrart Claire

1328
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:07,800
 a daunting adversary if there ever was one

1329
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:12,100
he wasn't particularly forthcoming with useful information however

1330
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,850
i'm a little intimidated by him honestly

1331
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,578
 he has stuff on me 

1332
01:22:18,578 --> 01:22:21,195
well we will have to work through that

1333
01:22:21,725 --> 01:22:23,300
 Claire also helped you

1334
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,475
 how should I say

1335
01:22:24,475 --> 01:22:25,766
 remember your name 

1336
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,266
that's a relief

1337
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,074
I don't know how I feel about my name

1338
01:22:31,074 --> 01:22:33,425
 we're getting honest here

1339
01:22:33,425 --> 01:22:34,366
 that's normal

1340
01:22:34,566 --> 01:22:36,666
it's best not to give it too much thought

1341
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:42,225
Kim is sounding very much like my therapist now

1342
01:22:42,225 --> 01:22:45,133
 we tried to interview the Wild Pines rep

1343
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:47,708
but she asked us to do something for her first

1344
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:48,975
 fine so be it

1345
01:22:49,325 --> 01:22:49,831
 okay

1346
01:22:49,872 --> 01:22:53,850
 I have a feeling Joyce knows how dangerous this situation really is

1347
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,966
 we have to get her to talk to us

1348
01:22:57,896 --> 01:23:00,513
above although today was exhausting

1349
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,513
 what´s with all the *running*

1350
01:23:02,513 --> 01:23:03,696
you run a lot

1351
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,770
 is that a standard precinct 41 practice

1352
01:23:07,213 --> 01:23:10,588
 I have a really good theory about why you're running so fast son

1353
01:23:11,322 --> 01:23:13,575
 just you wait until we get up tomorrow 

1354
01:23:14,266 --> 01:23:19,466
because our sympathetic nervous system is completely deregulated by addiction

1355
01:23:26,866 --> 01:23:28,500
I don't like to waste time

1356
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,617
 my mind moves fast

1357
01:23:29,617 --> 01:23:32,089
 I don't know why I do the things I do

1358
01:23:32,089 --> 01:23:32,826
 I genuinely don't

1359
01:23:32,826 --> 01:23:34,051
 it's impressive

1360
01:23:34,205 --> 01:23:35,950
 especially for a man your age

1361
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:37,741
 and in those heels

1362
01:23:39,046 --> 01:23:40,375
 nice shoes by the way

1363
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,625
 I like the green

1364
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,200
 goes with the orange 

1365
01:23:44,844 --> 01:23:45,844
thank you Kim

1366
01:23:47,966 --> 01:23:50,375
so what are our powers exactly the RCM

1367
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,050
they're quite limited actually

1368
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:56,312
 the power officers of the Revachol Citizens Militia exercise most *frequently*

1369
01:23:56,312 --> 01:23:59,550
 is imposing fines of up to 1000 reál for offences

1370
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:02,405
 in accordance with an interdepartmental schedule

1371
01:24:02,966 --> 01:24:03,775
why not more

1372
01:24:03,775 --> 01:24:06,516
 the RCM's primary role is to ensure safety

1373
01:24:06,516 --> 01:24:11,083
we are not really supposed to play any part in the economic structure of Ravachol

1374
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:12,579
see

1375
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:15,944
Kim doesn't want me to get involved in politics either

1376
01:24:16,789 --> 01:24:18,875
 wouldn't that be an easy power to abuse 

1377
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,300
 yes although indirectly

1378
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,713
 as citizens can always request records from their local station

1379
01:24:24,247 --> 01:24:26,214
 officers of the RCM have been known 

1380
01:24:26,214 --> 01:24:28,893
to take bribes of less than the prescribed fine amount

1381
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,266
 it undermines trust in the RCM 

1382
01:24:41,133 --> 01:24:46,691
so we're allowed to basically find people for things up to 1000

1383
01:24:48,466 --> 01:24:49,266
so

1384
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,950
maybe we can get some money that way

1385
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,225
but it does undermine their trust in us

1386
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:00,875
 okay what else

1387
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:02,244
 we can arrest people  of course

1388
01:25:02,244 --> 01:25:04,581
 but rather than bringing someone in directly 

1389
01:25:04,581 --> 01:25:07,250
it's preferable to serve a *station call* slip

1390
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:09,300
 it prevents confusion and overcrowding 

1391
01:25:11,733 --> 01:25:13,600
how can you be sure the arrestee will show up

1392
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,075
you can't

1393
01:25:14,398 --> 01:25:16,775
 those who don't show up become fugitives though

1394
01:25:16,775 --> 01:25:19,469
 and have fewer legal rights when they are eventually caught

1395
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,600
 it's about power projection 

1396
01:25:22,066 --> 01:25:24,057
thus far they seem to mostly show up

1397
01:25:24,225 --> 01:25:27,066
 when power calls you you come

1398
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:31,466
but power itself is a fragile trick of perception

1399
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:34,470
man authorities get away with words

1400
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:36,103
 what if someone resists

1401
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,873
we are permitted to use whatever force we deem necessary

1402
01:25:39,873 --> 01:25:41,100
 even lethal

1403
01:25:45,466 --> 01:25:46,911
what happens to the people we convict

1404
01:25:46,911 --> 01:25:47,936
 we don't convict 

1405
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:51,140
we arrest and send them to Coalition Government courts

1406
01:25:51,245 --> 01:25:52,678
 in Couron and La Delta 

1407
01:25:53,133 --> 01:25:55,500
the prosecution works off our testimonies

1408
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,533
 and records which is why it's paramount to keep them 

1409
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:03,800
wait so if I kill someone while on duty...

1410
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,361
you have to supply compelling evidence

1411
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,250
 for why it was necessary to use lethal force

1412
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,172
 in these cases your partner is usually your witness

1413
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,200
 *not* a good position to be in, by the way

1414
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,038
 internal affairs handles these cases thoroughly

1415
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:19,534
 by cross examining you for inconsistencies 

1416
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:22,000
it is hard to *cover* for anyone 

1417
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,466
which is for the best

1418
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,245
have you ever killed anyone Kim 

1419
01:26:25,245 --> 01:26:26,013
yes 

1420
01:26:26,566 --> 01:26:28,300
the last time was four years ago

1421
01:26:28,466 --> 01:26:31,266
he says it matter-of-factly and moves on

1422
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:34,375
have I killed anyone

1423
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:35,571
that's an improbability

1424
01:26:36,133 --> 01:26:37,733
perhaps even impossibility

1425
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,177
of course you've killed people 

1426
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,525
it's somewhere down there 

1427
01:26:42,525 --> 01:26:44,366
melting in all the drink

1428
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,975
I don't know if I really want to know 

1429
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:56,500
there's a lot of insecurity still in this process of like reintegration

1430
01:26:59,733 --> 01:27:02,590
think a part of me would want to

1431
01:27:03,422 --> 01:27:05,525
know everything

1432
01:27:05,525 --> 01:27:09,466
 so that I can narrate to myself that I

1433
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,441
I put as much honest effort into this as I can

1434
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,525
 but I would also feel like

1435
01:27:18,059 --> 01:27:21,850
 what good is knowing that going to do for me 

1436
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:26,333
if I already feel that it is wrong to do so again

1437
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,050
Precinct 41 is known for... 

1438
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:31,406
a higher-than-average rate of police violence 

1439
01:27:31,406 --> 01:27:32,631
he's not judging you 

1440
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:37,166
he's respectfully acknowledging the difficulty of working in your precinct

1441
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:43,125
authority with the rare empathetic take that he's not judging me 

1442
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:44,024
who makes all the rules 

1443
01:27:44,024 --> 01:27:46,733
the Coalition Government and the Moralintern more broadly 

1444
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,483
the RCM was formed by the Coalition Government 

1445
01:27:51,483 --> 01:27:54,977
to restore order in the International Zone after the Revolution 

1446
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:55,875
 so we did 

1447
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,463
now we attempt to maintain that order 

1448
01:27:58,463 --> 01:27:59,985
no more no less 

1449
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:04,511
or perhaps it is better to say we were allowed to form 

1450
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:06,484
it's a point of contention 

1451
01:28:06,484 --> 01:28:07,604
whether the citizens of Revachol

1452
01:28:07,604 --> 01:28:10,300
 or the Coalition Government founded the RCM 

1453
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,847
I don't have an opinion 

1454
01:28:13,847 --> 01:28:14,675
silence 

1455
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:17,466
a great comment to such a conundrum 

1456
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,166
the Moralintern what is

1457
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:29,000
the Moralist International are the world's largest political organization 

1458
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,466
you know who they are

1459
01:28:30,533 --> 01:28:33,466
they have been running this place after the Revolution failed

1460
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,400
okay

1461
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:46,075
if I didn't know how would you describe them

1462
01:28:46,075 --> 01:28:50,100
they are a union of center-left and center-right parties across the Reál Belt

1463
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,420
our Coalition Government is just one of its many projects 

1464
01:28:53,903 --> 01:28:56,803
they also run the ICP EPIS 

1465
01:28:56,803 --> 01:28:59,169
most inter-governmental organizations in the world 

1466
01:29:00,066 --> 01:29:01,166
oh jees

1467
01:29:04,766 --> 01:29:06,450
what do you think of them

1468
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,975
Moralintern are a fact 

1469
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:09,530
I try not to have opinions on facts

1470
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:10,755
until they change 

1471
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,991
and it doesn't look like that's about to happen 

1472
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,384
it is more than that 

1473
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:18,066
there's some kind of affection in him 

1474
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:19,616
the better not to ask 

1475
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:23,975
the lieutenant breathes out a chestnut-scented cloud cigarett smoke

1476
01:29:24,328 --> 01:29:26,803
and looks at the city he sworn to guard

1477
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,700
what do they believe in 

1478
01:29:31,037 --> 01:29:32,112
they are Dolorians

1479
01:29:32,384 --> 01:29:34,692
they believe they continue the humanist project 

1480
01:29:34,692 --> 01:29:38,286
set forth by her innocence Dolores Dei four centuries ago 

1481
01:29:38,286 --> 01:29:40,511
others say they're just technocrats

1482
01:29:41,025 --> 01:29:41,900
who was Dolores Dei

1483
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,075
a historic figure 

1484
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:44,925
the author of the modern age

1485
01:29:45,303 --> 01:29:47,750
you will have to look elsewhere for opinions 

1486
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,566
the subject of humanism is too abstract for me

1487
01:29:51,066 --> 01:29:53,166
okay can I just say

1488
01:29:58,133 --> 01:30:00,066
Kim is so real for that comment

1489
01:30:01,933 --> 01:30:04,450
this I connect so deeply with this 

1490
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:08,333
there's something that I have been trying to explain myself 

1491
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,066
they are subjects that are too abstracts for me like

1492
01:30:16,733 --> 01:30:19,000
you will have to look elsewhere for opinions

1493
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,273
the subject of humanism is too abstract for me 

1494
01:30:21,273 --> 01:30:24,539
substitute humanism and politics for me please 

1495
01:30:26,733 --> 01:30:32,137
you you will have to look elsewhere for opinions 

1496
01:30:32,137 --> 01:30:34,389
the subject of politics is too abstract from me 

1497
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:39,066
I fucking love this comment like for real 

1498
01:30:40,966 --> 01:30:41,855
thank you Kim 

1499
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,975
for you she is something painful 

1500
01:30:46,435 --> 01:30:48,133
though it's hard to say why 

1501
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,412
what is their *symbol*

1502
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,512
interesting question 

1503
01:30:52,512 --> 01:30:54,312
it's a blue forget-me-not 

1504
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:58,175
their moto is love compassion self-discipline 

1505
01:30:58,175 --> 01:31:01,466
I think you can gauge what they *want* you to think of them from that 

1506
01:31:03,966 --> 01:31:07,166
have fun being confronted with politics for the rest of the game

1507
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:09,700
no

1508
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:13,625
I'm not going to engage with it 

1509
01:31:14,243 --> 01:31:15,811
I'm not really interested in it

1510
01:31:15,811 --> 01:31:17,666
 nor do I have anything of value to say about it

1511
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:19,507
something ominous 

1512
01:31:20,284 --> 01:31:24,800
something even a little feminine but in a *strict* manner

1513
01:31:28,366 --> 01:31:30,700
I like that I like that Kim as a feminine side

1514
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:33,500
do you

1515
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:36,733
no not really

1516
01:31:48,466 --> 01:31:50,900
on second thought I don't have an opinion yeah

1517
01:31:50,966 --> 01:31:52,533
my kind of police officer

1518
01:31:55,098 --> 01:31:58,298
ah okay I am starting to develop the crush on Kim

1519
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,160
but it's only because we fought for it that I know it's real 

1520
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,875
the lights of the orphan district are reflected in his glasses

1521
01:32:07,072 --> 01:32:12,082
the red and golden orbs of the motorway sliding like pearls on a string 

1522
01:32:12,082 --> 01:32:16,832
from east to west as Revachol commutes back to the suburbs 

1523
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:18,723
tomorrow is Tuesday 

1524
01:32:18,723 --> 01:32:20,598
Monday is over 

1525
01:32:21,806 --> 01:32:25,200
what an intimate moment to share with him

1526
01:32:28,966 --> 01:32:31,362
Kim won over Brady by being anti-politics 

1527
01:32:31,362 --> 01:32:33,412
should have seen this coming 

1528
01:32:33,975 --> 01:32:35,533
who would have guessed

1529
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,156
Kim will embrace Brady's approach even if chat won't 

1530
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:44,421
see the game has has brought me validation 

1531
01:32:44,421 --> 01:32:49,575
Kim has given me clearance to not have an opinion 

1532
01:32:49,853 --> 01:32:54,066
because having an opinion makes me feel bad about this subject

1533
01:32:54,866 --> 01:33:00,571
and it only invites raw tense emotions from others 

1534
01:33:00,571 --> 01:33:04,066
which I am not prepared to deal with in my vulnerable state 

1535
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,275
say nothing 

1536
01:33:05,725 --> 01:33:08,366
just look into the sweet night with the sweet boy

1537
01:33:08,366 --> 01:33:11,441
the dying lights of the city shimmer below 

1538
01:33:11,863 --> 01:33:14,338
slowly like luminous clouds 

1539
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,363
they pass on his lenses

1540
01:33:16,933 --> 01:33:19,462
the lieutenant looks at his slim cigarette 

1541
01:33:19,462 --> 01:33:22,262
contemplating the next drag 

1542
01:33:22,727 --> 01:33:27,527
this *soldier* is the highlight of the day for me he thinks 

1543
01:33:28,065 --> 01:33:30,490
this little stick right here

1544
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:36,140
they really don't like us here 

1545
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:38,890
and the mouth on that kid Cuno 

1546
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,275
it's different inland 

1547
01:33:41,275 --> 01:33:43,600
in Jamrock and the GRIH

1548
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,666
why *are* they like this

1549
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,666
what's my school of thought in psychology

1550
01:33:51,666 --> 01:33:52,766
I'll talk about that later

1551
01:33:52,766 --> 01:33:55,151
it's our fault for leaving this place to the dogs

1552
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:57,065
 to the union to the company 

1553
01:33:57,065 --> 01:33:59,365
not daring to come here more often 

1554
01:33:59,935 --> 01:34:02,860
it's like I told you -- this place is an orphan 

1555
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,360
fallen between the cracks

1556
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:06,800
what did I say

1557
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,166
what did I say about the kids

1558
01:34:09,166 --> 01:34:14,143
I find that I am more and more right about my initial assumptions further we go 

1559
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,200
and in Jamrock and the GRIH 

1560
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,625
we run the city 

1561
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:19,866
west of the river is RCM land

1562
01:34:23,133 --> 01:34:24,925
it's incredibly hard 

1563
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,765
human beings are ...

1564
01:34:27,771 --> 01:34:29,800
but we are in control and it's worth it 

1565
01:34:30,304 --> 01:34:31,675
the organization works 

1566
01:34:31,675 --> 01:34:32,950
our systems work 

1567
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:35,652
if they didn't the city would disintegrate

1568
01:34:35,652 --> 01:34:39,900
 night captain Ptolemy Pryce steps into the yard  

1569
01:34:40,411 --> 01:34:43,125
a piebald horse waits by the motor carriage 

1570
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:45,333
chewing oats out of an oatbag 

1571
01:34:45,733 --> 01:34:47,475
seagulls fly overhead 

1572
01:34:47,784 --> 01:34:49,184
the sky is black 

1573
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:53,550
captain Pryce wears a black suit and a standard patrol coat 

1574
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:56,200
as he mounts the horse to head home

1575
01:34:56,333 --> 01:35:00,675
rows of houses on either side hunching over the sidewalks 

1576
01:35:00,675 --> 01:35:04,575
and precinct 41 with its dome roof growing distant 

1577
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:07,125
around him the streets are silent 

1578
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:12,966
a kid on the corner waves at the captain as he takes the turn on Perdition and Main

1579
01:35:12,966 --> 01:35:14,350
the horse neighs

1580
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:16,166
the captain nods back

1581
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:21,466
there is something here

1582
01:35:22,966 --> 01:35:25,166
a young child seeing perhaps

1583
01:35:26,666 --> 01:35:29,533
life isn't going to be miserable when I become an adult

1584
01:35:31,582 --> 01:35:35,116
thanks kid he thinks  he's grateful 

1585
01:35:39,966 --> 01:35:42,525
I hope our investigation will help improve the situation here 

1586
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:43,800
at least do some *good*

1587
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:47,666
but I wouldn't count on any drastic changes in our lifetimes

1588
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,266
thank you for this

1589
01:35:49,266 --> 01:35:51,866
yeah it's getting very cold now let's go

1590
01:35:55,266 --> 01:35:56,486
okay I'm a little smitten now 

1591
01:35:57,663 --> 01:35:58,333
okay

1592
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,100
now what we will do is go to sleep

1593
01:36:01,566 --> 01:36:04,066
and then we'll end this little chapter of our adventure

1594
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,820
everyone falls for Kim no exceptions  

1595
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,300
I was never against it

1596
01:36:21,366 --> 01:36:29,360
but I genuinely did not think it was earned narratively psychologically 

1597
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,125
from where we started  

1598
01:36:32,737 --> 01:36:34,733
we started in this room

1599
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,500
not as an empty slate okay

1600
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:43,875
like someone who is a blank slate

1601
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:47,133
does not like

1602
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:54,266
does not do the kinds of things that we saw from my character right like

1603
01:36:55,933 --> 01:37:00,025
in the beginning all that we were chasing were impulses right

1604
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,000
violent tendencies

1605
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:05,148
substance related tendencies 

1606
01:37:05,585 --> 01:37:06,566
simple...

1607
01:37:08,266 --> 01:37:10,903
gratification structures like getting money 

1608
01:37:10,903 --> 01:37:12,653
being able to buy something 

1609
01:37:12,653 --> 01:37:15,800
being able to buy something that can give us a small sense of relief

1610
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,346
winning confrontations with people

1611
01:37:19,346 --> 01:37:21,091
 like that's what it was all built on 

1612
01:37:21,091 --> 01:37:27,000
because those are like the quick paths to building self esteem

1613
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,166
but they are the wrong paths to building self esteem right

1614
01:37:30,166 --> 01:37:32,466
this entire time I've been trying to demonstrate something

1615
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:35,600
just about like

1616
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,488
we do not always do what is in our best interest 

1617
01:37:39,488 --> 01:37:42,318
just because the thought to do so is available to us 

1618
01:37:43,013 --> 01:37:43,538
you know 

1619
01:37:44,536 --> 01:37:46,049
the thought to be close to Kim

1620
01:37:46,049 --> 01:37:48,366
 has been available to us from the very beginning

1621
01:37:48,366 --> 01:37:50,977
but that does not mean that we pursue it freely 

1622
01:37:50,977 --> 01:37:53,627
just like we don't in real life ever 

1623
01:37:54,475 --> 01:37:55,333
it takes time

1624
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:58,180
it takes trial and error it takes pushing boundaries 

1625
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:02,330
it takes realizing what people's clear intentions are 

1626
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:05,860
and it takes like realizing that

1627
01:38:07,266 --> 01:38:09,725
although it is effortful it is hard 

1628
01:38:10,147 --> 01:38:14,300
it's not easy work to do the right thing or to be the right person 

1629
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,950
it is worth it

1630
01:38:18,933 --> 01:38:22,458
when we have someone who reflects that it is worth it 

1631
01:38:23,235 --> 01:38:24,101
next to us

1632
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:32,514
so I do think it was inevitable but not for free 

1633
01:38:33,425 --> 01:38:36,285
so for that reason I'm glad that we developed 

1634
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:38,175
 we're starting to develop a relationship with Kim  

1635
01:38:38,175 --> 01:38:39,766
that feels very earned

1636
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:45,000
with that said

1637
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,375
we pause at the doorway 

1638
01:38:49,769 --> 01:38:53,014
we glance towards the mirror on the far end of the room 

1639
01:38:53,014 --> 01:38:55,727
and we consider looking into it 

1640
01:38:55,727 --> 01:38:58,644
and we decide  not yet  

1641
01:38:59,719 --> 01:39:02,769
the bed is cold and not particularly inviting

1642
01:39:03,133 --> 01:39:04,400
but it's yours 

1643
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,100
the sheets look awful

1644
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:07,700
doesn't matter 

1645
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:09,000
crawl in

1646
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:14,490
the sheets feel at once coarse and clammy against your skin 

1647
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:17,749
the bed sags beneath your weight as you stretch out

1648
01:39:17,749 --> 01:39:19,681
 and finally close your eyes

1649
01:39:23,784 --> 01:39:25,884
and then 

1650
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:29,384
and then sleep doesn't come

1651
01:39:31,197 --> 01:39:31,799
why

1652
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,431
maybe it's the beds fault 

1653
01:39:34,275 --> 01:39:35,066
rollovers

1654
01:39:35,066 --> 01:39:36,225
a little better 

1655
01:39:36,225 --> 01:39:41,000
colors scenes and half-formed phrases still litter your mind 

1656
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,630
part of you is still trying to solve the case isn't it 

1657
01:39:45,084 --> 01:39:45,800
who killed him 

1658
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,425
something to do with 

1659
01:39:47,425 --> 01:39:49,728
what was it that  the lieutenant said 

1660
01:39:49,728 --> 01:39:50,500
union 

1661
01:39:51,022 --> 01:39:52,125
and it's gone again 

1662
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:56,000
your thoughts lost between the slowing brain waves 

1663
01:39:56,366 --> 01:39:57,521
no more thoughts fall asleep 

1664
01:39:57,521 --> 01:39:59,133
your breathing steadies

1665
01:39:59,366 --> 01:40:01,950
a great silence washes over you 

1666
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:05,799
until your eyelids twitch in your sleep and images...

1667
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:07,699
images start forming

1668
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:17,025
well is this like a dream state

1669
01:40:26,133 --> 01:40:27,533
oh it's a disco

1670
01:40:29,133 --> 01:40:30,200
oh fuck

1671
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,975
do you remember the scent of your childhood

1672
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,333
what *is* this

1673
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:42,475
what it says on the can harry 

1674
01:40:42,475 --> 01:40:44,000
answer the question 

1675
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:48,766
I remember nothing

1676
01:40:48,866 --> 01:40:52,600
do you remember your wife's hand on your face 

1677
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,940
I left 

1678
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:00,575
I believe that we left 

1679
01:41:00,575 --> 01:41:03,975
oh no funky baby you *stayed*

1680
01:41:03,975 --> 01:41:06,266
it was the rest of you that left 

1681
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,000
or you just stood there

1682
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,110
with one hand on the bottle and the other on your dick 

1683
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:15,600
watching it go 

1684
01:41:16,266 --> 01:41:17,168
tell me

1685
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:19,638
where are your friends 

1686
01:41:19,975 --> 01:41:23,200
human beings have friends Harry-boy 

1687
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,393
where the hell are yours

1688
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,133
shit

1689
01:41:29,366 --> 01:41:31,300
this is this is

1690
01:41:33,466 --> 01:41:34,300
it's dark

1691
01:41:37,266 --> 01:41:39,045
I think this is more true to make character

1692
01:41:39,045 --> 01:41:43,077
they were only cramping your *descent into the abyss* 

1693
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:45,200
now they're gone 

1694
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:49,025
three times gone and never coming back 

1695
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:50,805
all of it 

1696
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,266
you failed

1697
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,075
you failed me

1698
01:41:56,508 --> 01:41:58,800
you faild Elysium

1699
01:41:59,394 --> 01:42:01,167
what is Elysium 

1700
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:02,594
everything

1701
01:42:03,266 --> 01:42:05,445
the pale and the isolas 

1702
01:42:05,969 --> 01:42:07,794
on the surface

1703
01:42:08,432 --> 01:42:11,060
the outer magnetosphere 

1704
01:42:12,157 --> 01:42:15,232
burning furious truth

1705
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:20,719
a thousand years of written history 

1706
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,285
you really dropped the bow Harry 

1707
01:42:25,066 --> 01:42:28,468
four point six billion people

1708
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,099
and you failed every single one of them 

1709
01:42:33,084 --> 01:42:36,066
you really fucked up

1710
01:42:37,066 --> 01:42:38,400
oh my god 

1711
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,450
I've talked to you before 

1712
01:42:42,872 --> 01:42:45,075
something tells me we have been here before

1713
01:42:45,466 --> 01:42:46,450
no Harry

1714
01:42:47,533 --> 01:42:49,810
you were just talking to yourself 

1715
01:42:50,684 --> 01:42:52,737
that's all you ever do 

1716
01:42:53,159 --> 01:42:55,359
even in your dreams 

1717
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:58,485
and the act is wearing thin 

1718
01:42:59,382 --> 01:43:03,232
the spots of the disco ball fade around you

1719
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:10,040
you'll be back in those cold snake skins in no time 

1720
01:43:10,463 --> 01:43:12,813
sweating up the bed

1721
01:43:13,846 --> 01:43:15,888
stinky boy

1722
01:43:18,766 --> 01:43:20,284
I can come back from this

1723
01:43:20,284 --> 01:43:22,893
you're not coming back from shit 

1724
01:43:22,893 --> 01:43:28,250
thrashing around in that high conductivity stay of yours 

1725
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:31,841
bumping into things and acting like a *clown* 

1726
01:43:32,566 --> 01:43:33,966
who are you kidding

1727
01:43:36,766 --> 01:43:40,966
i'm trying to solve trying to solve this case

1728
01:43:40,966 --> 01:43:45,475
it's the one thing I have in my life that gives me a clear objective 

1729
01:43:45,475 --> 01:43:48,625
because everything else is an open fucking road 

1730
01:43:48,625 --> 01:43:50,569
and I do not know how to navigate it 

1731
01:43:50,569 --> 01:43:52,344
you're trying to what

1732
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,675
I can't hear you 

1733
01:43:54,675 --> 01:43:57,850
this is just a word dream now 

1734
01:43:57,850 --> 01:43:59,733
jumbled up garbage

1735
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:03,741
the pictures are gone the bed rises to meet you 

1736
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:06,091
a thin sleep like state 

1737
01:44:06,825 --> 01:44:11,075
more glass then velvet *grinding* in your head 

1738
01:44:11,075 --> 01:44:13,225
so-something is wrong 

1739
01:44:13,732 --> 01:44:15,700
sleep shouldn't be this bad

1740
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,150
this dry 

1741
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:19,250
this un-nourishing 

1742
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:21,987
there's something wrong with your thoughts 

1743
01:44:22,915 --> 01:44:27,732
some kind of new type of hangover

1744
01:44:28,066 --> 01:44:30,466
there is definitely something wrong with our thoughts

1745
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,925
oh yes party boy 

1746
01:44:33,925 --> 01:44:37,350
and it's worse than the one before 

1747
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:40,375
just think of the shit you saw 

1748
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:44,636
here it comes too so soon already 

1749
01:44:44,636 --> 01:44:47,225
a silent alarm goes off in your head 

1750
01:44:47,225 --> 01:44:50,716
like clockwork barely let you sleep at all 

1751
01:44:50,988 --> 01:44:55,429
time to get those clothes on Harry

1752
01:44:55,766 --> 01:45:01,025
time to go to work in the shit factory

1753
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:11,200
well there's a lot there

1754
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:23,133
good going buddy

1755
01:45:27,466 --> 01:45:28,487
what the hell was that 

1756
01:45:28,487 --> 01:45:30,025
oh just a dream 

1757
01:45:30,654 --> 01:45:33,050
you have ones like that all the time 

1758
01:45:33,612 --> 01:45:37,025
you feel even worse this morning than you did last night 

1759
01:45:37,025 --> 01:45:38,266
what is going on with me

1760
01:45:38,266 --> 01:45:40,392
you mean why are you so tired 

1761
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:44,100
too tired and down to even think 

1762
01:45:44,502 --> 01:45:47,025
it is worrying isn't it 

1763
01:45:47,025 --> 01:45:49,050
you can't be a detective like this 

1764
01:45:49,455 --> 01:45:51,750
detectives need to be able to  think 

1765
01:45:52,185 --> 01:45:52,975
why is this happening 

1766
01:45:52,975 --> 01:45:55,657
it's just that your heart has finally pumped all the *speed* 

1767
01:45:55,657 --> 01:45:57,975
out of your system buster 

1768
01:45:57,975 --> 01:46:00,000
time to get some more 

1769
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,305
don't do that 

1770
01:46:01,305 --> 01:46:02,580
stay strong 

1771
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:04,780
the hangover will wear off 

1772
01:46:05,075 --> 01:46:07,566
you don't need to keep doing this to yourself  

1773
01:46:07,566 --> 01:46:11,106
okay so what I find interesting is that volition...

1774
01:46:11,106 --> 01:46:16,666
is shiming in more often to counter electrochemistry 

1775
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:23,500
um and half light as well like I said though

1776
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,466
volition in our real life

1777
01:46:27,533 --> 01:46:33,672
the self-interest mechanism is very hard to listen to 

1778
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:36,100
takes a lot of effort

1779
01:46:42,666 --> 01:46:47,102
we're going to try to not do drugs 

1780
01:46:47,102 --> 01:46:49,450
we never wanted to do them 

1781
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,800
this has not been a

1782
01:46:52,733 --> 01:46:55,240
like this has not been a play through about 

1783
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:58,259
taking drugs for their benefits  

1784
01:46:58,259 --> 01:47:01,677
there's been a play through about the dangers of addiction 

1785
01:47:02,437 --> 01:47:06,011
and how they hijacked our moral priorities

1786
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,250
so this is the thought 

1787
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:14,427
the thought can be anything it can even be in our best interest 

1788
01:47:14,427 --> 01:47:17,185
and we may still result in a behavior of relapse

1789
01:47:19,133 --> 01:47:21,200
which is probably what we'll end up doing

1790
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,875
are you sure 

1791
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:27,017
ready to live as this pathetic shell of yourself for days 

1792
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:29,517
basically a week 

1793
01:47:29,738 --> 01:47:33,550
let's be honest two weeks maybe three 

1794
01:47:33,903 --> 01:47:35,275
you won't make it 

1795
01:47:35,275 --> 01:47:37,815
half the town will be dead by then

1796
01:47:38,157 --> 01:47:39,907
you will be fired 

1797
01:47:43,074 --> 01:47:43,666
that's a lie 

1798
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,091
I can do this without the speed 

1799
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:46,249
half the town won't be dead

1800
01:47:47,751 --> 01:47:49,400
part of me thinks that 

1801
01:47:49,777 --> 01:47:52,241
again like you can have a very virtuous thought like this 

1802
01:47:52,241 --> 01:47:53,933
and still result in a

1803
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,133
behavior that is against self interest

1804
01:48:00,533 --> 01:48:03,889
but what is fresh in my mind right now is

1805
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:06,540
 the conversation I had with Kim 

1806
01:48:09,333 --> 01:48:15,175
that is starting to shape some of my core beliefs to

1807
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,266
even if it's not true

1808
01:48:19,266 --> 01:48:20,900
I can still believe that

1809
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,725
like I'm not catastrophizing 

1810
01:48:24,725 --> 01:48:26,686
catastrophizing is like when

1811
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:33,968
when you go to the extreme level of consequences for even small issues

1812
01:48:35,666 --> 01:48:38,019
which is definitely a habit of our detective here 

1813
01:48:38,019 --> 01:48:40,298
but we're going to try to not do that 

1814
01:48:40,298 --> 01:48:42,242
that's a lie I can do this without the speed 

1815
01:48:42,242 --> 01:48:46,000
suit yourself slow sad shell-man 

1816
01:48:46,337 --> 01:48:48,450
see how you do without your spark 

1817
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:50,258
we're going to see

1818
01:48:51,966 --> 01:48:52,891
okay

1819
01:48:54,733 --> 01:48:55,533
again

1820
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,975
we'll look at the mirror 

1821
01:48:58,975 --> 01:49:00,600
we'll think about it 

1822
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,266
and we'll move off

1823
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:06,975
thank you for watching my video 

1824

01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:11,166
and letting me know what you thought of it in the comments 

1826

or you can see things a little bit earlier if you support the channel 

1828
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:18,075
either through Twitch or Patreon 

1829
01:49:18,075 --> 01:49:21,600
links to both of those and the community discord are in the description 

1830
