1
00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:01,297
hello

2
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:02,451
 and welcome back to my

3
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:05,117
therapist plays Disco Elysium Analysis series

4
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:06,167
in today's episode

5
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,853
we are going to be taking a very thorough look at

6
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:12,572
how Disco Elysium portrays intrusive thinking

7
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:16,192
 when electrochemistry starts giving us thoughts  

8
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:19,917
and they are very much opposed to the thoughts of volition 

9
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:23,317
and how this actually very accurately represents 

10
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:25,951
some of our very real thinking patterns

11
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:28,317
so we're gonna be using actual theory to break this down 

12
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,484
using the cognitive model

13
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:33,351
how actual cognitive behavioral therapy works

14
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:36,246
and how we might apply it to a situation that

15
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:40,117
 our detective finds himself in with his own intrusive thinking 

16
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,551
this one's gonna be quite in depth

17
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,617
so I'm excited to get into it

18
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:44,917
let's dive it

19
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:47,151
all right

20
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:51,151
so what we need to do now is figure out

21
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:54,884
where to go

22
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:03,017
this door he wants me to bust down

23
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:25,551
oh there's a end-of-day debrief 

24
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,961
Kim can answer any lingering questions  

25
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,471
you may have about the case and the RCM 

26
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:32,451
 join him in the Whirling-in-Rags' balcony after 10

27
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,117
so what time is it

28
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:37,517
it's almost 10

29
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:42,117
so we've got a little bit of time before we can do that 

30
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:54,884
do we have enough money to pay back Mr Garte

31
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:57,484
do we have enough

32
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,917
do we have it's got a ton of trash

33
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,484
let's go turn in the trash

34
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:07,117
let's pay a visit to the best character in this entire game 

35
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:09,151
Frittte girl

36
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:12,017
let's see what she's up to

37
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,484
and let's get some money

38
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:25,851
yeah we're not accepting that bribe fuck that guy

39
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,686
I don't care I'll

40
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:31,658
we'll solve our many problems

41
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,417
 through rigorous environmentalism 

42
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:52,528
I believe I'm supposed to talk to this gentleman first though 

43
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:53,705
 see what he's got to say

44
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:55,851
 so how'd you like our harbor 

45
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:00,151
was nice enough

46
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,684
let's remain neutral

47
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:05,298
it's but a rest area on the path leading across open plains 

48
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:08,465
all right

49
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:09,369
you talk to the boss

50
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:12,098
eye-to-eye like men of the plain

51
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:15,017
if you have any more questions I'm set to talk

52
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:17,334
Evrart said you have a key to the door

53
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:17,954
a key huh

54
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,951
what door is this key supposed to open

55
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,851
he set it belonged to a weasel

56
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,084
I was hoping you could tell me let's just go with that

57
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:28,717
of course I got you

58
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,217
you don't know anything

59
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:33,951
he taps the side of his nose with a little

60
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:35,851
I got that key right here

61
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,017
and let me tell you

62
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,717
it's mighty good of you to help us out during the strike 

63
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,951
working class solidarity as they say

64
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:50,484
see if I can get some information out of him

65
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,717
I'm a hustle grinder

66
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,117
I'm not really doing this for political reasons

67
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:59,451
that's very in line with me

68
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,451
oh so the none-of-the-above type are you

69
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,017
I get it I get it

70
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:04,951
I like to keep my distance too

71
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:06,684
but it doesn't matter

72
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:09,717
it's a good thing you're doing thanks

73
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,036
what you're looking for is a basement door behind the greenhouse 

74
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,259
 that's behind the Whirling-in-rags

75
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,484
that's all I know

76
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,917
our organization is what you call compartmentalized

77
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,217
means we keep out of each other's business

78
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,484
okay but where did you get the key from 

79
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:26,317
good question

80
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,484
the janitor gave it to me

81
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:28,991
nice fella

82
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:32,084
 we talked about life and things that really truly matter 

83
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:37,284
none of this mess we're in this javing and juggling

84
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,351
what's it for

85
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,651
to feed our children I guess

86
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,284
anything else I should know about this task

87
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,151
this weasel person

88
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:45,917
when he'll be home

89
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,117
I'm more of a philosophical dockworker

90
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,451
I like to talk about the big picture stuff

91
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,417
who I am who you are

92
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,117
what we are fighting for

93
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,417
hey thank you so much for the hydrate immortal

94
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:00,517
we'll do that now

95
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:11,017
so he's a he's a deep thinker

96
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:14,284
who he is and what they're fighting for

97
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,151
this is interesting

98
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,684
why are you striking

99
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,151
we're negotiating our share

100
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:20,442
your share 

101
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:20,917
aye

102
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,417
how large a share would you like

103
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,451
let's ask him

104
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,284
all of it

105
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:31,017
however right now

106
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,884
we want all the harbor workers to be on the company's board 

107
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:36,817
so they could take part in the decision making process

108
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:41,205
let's ask him about Evrart

109
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:42,817
I think it's best you make up your own mind

110
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:43,617
now that you've made

111
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,317
in my eyes

112
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:48,284
he is a capable organizer and a decent businessman

113
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,684
what has bossing the union entails anyway

114
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,251
I guess you kinda get to be the village chief

115
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:53,817
he oversees the harbor

116
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,317
makes deals with the owners or other relevant parties

117
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:57,717
watches out for his own

118
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,051
by that you mean corruption

119
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:01,496
got him 

120
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:03,317
by heavens why would he not be corrupt

121
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:05,884
we live in a harsh and disorder world see

122
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,351
and in this world

123
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,966
the old man is corrupt for our benefit

124
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:10,817
 and we know it

125
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:12,217
appreciate it even

126
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,084
he is personally not too lavish

127
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,717
that desk seemed lavish to me

128
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,551
he is reasonably lavish sure

129
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,217
that's his prerogative

130
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:25,651
it's not like you want a saintly demeanor on a corrupt motherfucker 

131
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,484
that would be a manipulative illusion

132
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:32,951
as someone so careful with your words

133
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:36,617
you're letting some vulgarity slip through here friend

134
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:37,151
what's going on

135
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:37,651
besides

136
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:40,217
there are no non-corrupt systems in the world anyway

137
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:42,717
and moralism is the most corruptive them all

138
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,351
what

139
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,917
not you you would like to say

140
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,551
but then there's that weasle door

141
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:56,551
how is moralism corrupt

142
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:01,417
I don't really know what moralism entails in this context though 

143
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:03,021
are you a communist

144
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,517
 no

145
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:06,217
I don't think I'm a communist

146
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:09,385
seeing something of value when saying I want it all to myself 

147
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,651
 is a much older and simpler notion

148
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:13,279
no science to it at all

149
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,251
 even a weak child can think it

150
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,151
the only things holding someone back are I can't and I shouldn't 

151
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,717
moralism is centralism

152
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:28,551
that does not help me

153
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:36,051
that I am further from understanding that now actually 

154
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:39,411
you shouldn't take what's not yours  

155
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:40,451
I mean I agree with that

156
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,717
then how can anything ever be mine

157
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,388
but that's okay 

158
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:45,651
we don't have to agree

159
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,451
the prairie is wide enough for all of us

160
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,717
moralism is the international political group that took over the revolution 

161
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,117
like Rene talked about

162
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,751
it's the main ideology of the ruling class

163
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,251
it's basically American liberalism

164
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,151
centrism coalition they're the do-nothing party

165
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:13,680
there's so many things here that I

166
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,117
that are out of my scope

167
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:25,017
ah yeah well there's a spoiler policy

168
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:28,284
but sometimes I'm just gonna ask for information because like 

169
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,017
I'll be honest like

170
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:31,817
I'm gonna

171
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:35,051
I'm inviting this now I know but like

172
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,917
certain kinds of spoilers I really don't care about

173
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:42,151
like obviously

174
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:43,151
I don't want people to tell me

175
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,117
what happens in the game

176
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:46,617
if I am gonna find that out on my own

177
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,051
but like

178
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:52,084
the things that are the most egregious spoilers to me are like 

179
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,251
character things

180
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:58,051
like I do wish that I would have probably discovered the 

181
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:00,917
the name thing on my own

182
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:04,117
I don't think it's like the worst thing ever but

183
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:09,917
like character development as spoilers to me

184
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,159
but telling me what moralism is like 

185
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,084
tell me because

186
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:16,817
so out of my scope

187
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:21,851
you seem to think you seem to have spent a lot of time 

188
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,551
thinking about the political situation

189
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:24,309
let's ask him that

190
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:26,817
 sure I've had the necessary free time

191
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,517
fortunately there's always time

192
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:35,251
okay the look in his brown eyes conjures up an understanding 

193
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:39,517
for him having command of his time is the most important thing 

194
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:42,251
the man sits on the railing

195
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,684
his hands reaching far and wide

196
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:50,317
yet it feels as if he could effortlessly go even wider if need be 

197
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,451
an endless torrent of time

198
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,717
hmm okay well 

199
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:59,017
he did say he would tell me more about this murder once I talked to his boss  

200
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:00,417
any idea who killed the hangman

201
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,651
the mercenary aye

202
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,884
who could have killed him that's indeed the question

203
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:07,151
why even do such a thing

204
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,517
it's a good question

205
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:12,557
the Harbor is a prime area of suspicion 

206
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:15,517
in your opinion are the dockworkers involved in the killing 

207
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:16,517
what a thought

208
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:19,417
why would noble workers resort to such a thing

209
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,284
unless they were pushed of course

210
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:25,840
pushed how

211
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,917
 your dead guy

212
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:29,551
was an enemy combatant

213
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,451
did you kill him no we're not gonna go there

214
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:32,451
hold up what does that mean

215
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:34,151
it was an agent of the opposition

216
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,884
attempting to undermine our honorable efforts

217
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,084
did you kill him

218
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,217
I ain't the murderin' type

219
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:40,351
but that's just me

220
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,617
large organizations like our union

221
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:43,817
have all sorts of men

222
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:46,317
with all sorts of skills

223
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,617
this could be a red herring

224
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,484
couldn't have nothing to do with the union at all

225
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,984
he means a more violent faction 

226
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,217
could easily take care of such a thing 

227
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:01,117
or the least violent

228
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:01,917
understood

229
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,851
this has been of limited use

230
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:05,317
still thank you

231
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:08,684
no problem I wish the best to you in your search

232
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,917
sure am glad it's not my search

233
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:14,517
all right gotta run 

234
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:16,717
so

235
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,717
trash money sleep

236
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,817
parasympathetic nervous system

237
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,484
is telling me my body needs to rest

238
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,884
damn that felt good 

239
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:33,917
your heart's pounding nicely

240
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:37,484
you should tell people to fuck off more often

241
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:38,899
I should I should do that

242
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,084
 no you shouldn't

243
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,884
you're an officer of the law

244
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:42,884
maybe I shouldn't

245
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:44,374
I love this

246
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:46,651
 I fucking love this

247
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,862
this portrayal of mental states 

248
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,717
that are in competition with one another 

249
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,517
is so good so accurate

250
00:11:56,551 --> 00:12:01,651
like I really do actually want to talk about this 

251
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:08,817
a little more in depth

252
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:17,151
if you don't mind me indulging a little bit in some psychology 

253
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:23,782
so like I talked about that here 

254
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,751
the whole competing mental states thing 

255
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:30,751
but let me give you a little bit of like additional context so 

256
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,251
like

257
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:37,484
CBT right cognitive behavioral therapy

258
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:40,651
it uses something called the cognitive model

259
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:42,517
which is like essentially

260
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,540
that the chain of events is 

261
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,851
we have a thought

262
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,951
we have an emotion

263
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:54,017
and then we have like a behavior

264
00:12:56,473 --> 00:13:00,140
and most of the time we actually work backwards 

265
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,592
when we are detecting these things 

266
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:05,351
because our behaviors are so much more observable right 

267
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,884
it's like simple cause and effect

268
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,117
for example I'll do it like this 

269
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:19,451
my behavior is I smoked

270
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,417
my behavior is I confronted someone

271
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:30,351
my behavior is that I cried 

272
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,951
my behavior is that I

273
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,751
you know slouched in the chair

274
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:44,851
my behavior in Evrart's office was like 

275
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:46,751
fidgeting

276
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,684
right my behavior

277
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:56,751
when I was talking to Frittte girl is like

278
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:01,617
right just talking conversing

279
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:03,151
let's put conversing

280
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:13,217
some of my other behaviors would be 

281
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:15,617
fighting

282
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:23,684
cursing right

283
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:25,884
because we're talking about like telling people to fuck off 

284
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:27,517
and confronting and that sort of thing

285
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:32,217
resting right that's another behavior

286
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,517
you can see that like

287
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:36,284
it's very easy to identify our behaviors

288
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:37,817
these are the things that we do

289
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:44,251
we're quite good at giving like a historical account of things 

290
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,851
and I think that for our character

291
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,417
it's also particularly interesting because he's like

292
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:53,551
he's asking a lot of questions like what did I do

293
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:55,884
in terms of like who was I

294
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:57,917
some of his questions have been like

295
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,086
was I a good cop right

296
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:02,551
 like did I do my job

297
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:03,211
did I perform well 

298
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:04,331
was I a good person right 

299
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,351
here behavior is 

300
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,417
the most obvious most avert part of this process 

301
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,051
but it's also the most limited in

302
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:16,051
understanding the source of our anxieties right

303
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:19,884
because like now we have to take a step back actually 

304
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:22,817
the way it works is we have a thought

305
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:24,817
that thought gives us an emotion

306
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:27,217
and based on that emotion we make a behavior

307
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:28,817
but when we're trying to understand these things

308
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:31,217
we actually have to work our way backwards right

309
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:34,817
so if I did something like smoked

310
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,617
the behavior is

311
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,617
you know lighting up a cigarette or something

312
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:41,675
what is the emotion

313
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:48,017
what is the emotion that I'm having as I do that right 

314
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,884
some of the emotions my character has had are like

315
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:56,851
anxiety

316
00:15:58,317 --> 00:15:59,117
fear

317
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:00,951
regret

318
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,351
sadness

319
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,002
grief 

320
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,284
loss of personal self

321
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,717
I would actually say that like empathy is

322
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:20,017
more of a behavior in this sense

323
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,884
like we are empathizing with someone

324
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,817
that's a verb right we empathize

325
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,951
but the emotion attached to empathy is

326
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,151
it's even hard for me to come up with some of these

327
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,317
sometimes right like

328
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,851
it's a kind of like sadness

329
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:38,183
what did what did Tommy call it

330
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:41,751
 like an aching of the soul or something 

331
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,417
right it's painful

332
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:52,084
some of the emotions that we've had were like happiness right 

333
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:58,451
we were happy when we got like a cigarette when

334
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,551
when we got some money right

335
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,684
compassion yeah that's a great one

336
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,351
feeling compassionate

337
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:14,017
anger is a big one

338
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:17,284
loneliness

339
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,217
isolation

340
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:24,254
it's kind of like one of those 

341
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,917
shame yeah great

342
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:27,551
right

343
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:34,317
so like it's pretty it's a little bit more difficult 

344
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,284
but still we can detect these things right

345
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:39,284
and we can even say okay well when I'm feeling anxious

346
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,084
I might do all of these things

347
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,451
I might smoke when I'm anxious

348
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:43,851
I might confront someone

349
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:45,376
I might start crying

350
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,684
 I might slouch in my chair

351
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:47,884
I might start fidgeting

352
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:50,151
I might start talking right

353
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,251
I might fight with someone

354
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:54,317
like anxiety can be a source for all of these things

355
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:00,617
what could shame make us want to do right

356
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,317
it could make us want to isolate

357
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,617
it could make us fight with people 

358
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,651
it could make us cry as well right like

359
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:12,817
there's multiple routes that this can take

360
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,051
but this is where Disco Elysium comes in with like

361
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:21,251
the the thoughts that your character is having right

362
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:24,217
this is brilliant right here

363
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:27,217
so the game is saying like damn that felt good

364
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,451
that s a thought

365
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:34,817
right

366
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:41,117
this is a neutral objective like automatic thought that we're having 

367
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:45,709
and like the emotion that we might have from that 

368
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,217
 is maybe one over like relief 

369
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:54,217
and so when we have this thought and this emotion

370
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:57,317
like what is the behavior that it's telling us to do

371
00:18:57,451 --> 00:19:00,017
it's telling us to go confront someone right

372
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,617
it's saying damn that felt good

373
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:03,951
your heart's pounding nicely

374
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:06,417
you should tell people to fuck off more often

375
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:11,551
is this a good way to experience relief though

376
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,109
because I think without the thought

377
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,617
 if I took this away

378
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:20,917
right and I asked you well what do we

379
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:24,517
what's the when we feel relief what do we do

380
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:27,484
we might say oh well you know

381
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:31,251
we we rest we have a good conversation right

382
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:36,617
we might socialize we might relax 

383
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:39,750
but no right 

384
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:44,448
the emotion is only connected to a behavior 

385
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,851
in a very limited sense 

386
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:51,517
we don't get the full context of how emotions work

387
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:55,884
unless we actually have a thought attached to it

388
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:01,117
which can totally upset the relationship between

389
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,658
something like relief and a behavior

390
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:04,351
 because

391
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:06,451
that felt good

392
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,851
is telling me that relief is connected to confrontation 

393
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:14,117
that in fact feeling anxiety like that

394
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:17,155
kind of like heart pumping tension

395
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:18,451
 is like good for you

396
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,051
like you should get in more fights

397
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,451
you should curse more often right

398
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:26,017
if you want to feel relief you cannot empathize

399
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:30,351
half light is disrupting your

400
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,917
what we would say is a healthy relationship between

401
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:40,373
the emotion of relief and the behaviors that might follow it  

402
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:43,173
but then you have something like volition that comes in 

403
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:45,484
 and says like no you shouldn't 

404
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,973
you're an officer of the law right 

405
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,151
what is this

406
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,017
 this is appealing to my own sense of moralism

407
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,884
and the idea that like you should

408
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:08,517
you shouldn't do that you're an officer of the law

409
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:14,284
to me what that's getting into is like a sense of shame 

410
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,958
 over like that's not something that someone

411
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,751
 with a strong moral code would do 

412
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:20,550
regret

413
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,317
 you should not have made that choice

414
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:23,153
and fear 

415
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:29,551
for how you will come off to people who are trying to uphold a professional  

416
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:32,417
you know law abiding posture to

417
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,517
and then those

418
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:37,151
despite shame regret and fear

419
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,451
seeming like very negative emotions

420
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,951
what kinds of behaviors are they going to lead to

421
00:21:43,717 --> 00:21:48,017
they're actually going to lead you to empathy 

422
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,051
standing up for someone

423
00:21:56,084 --> 00:22:00,517
to not confronting them but trying to understand right

424
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:04,251
they're going to lead you to honesty

425
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:06,651
the behavior of honesty right

426
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:09,484
they're going to lead you to apology

427
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:16,595
and so now you have what looked like negative emotions 

428
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:22,317
 leading you to very positive coded behaviors right 

429
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,217
so the cognitive model is all about how like

430
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:27,717
when you're missing

431
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:30,939
this part of it 

432
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:34,051
right like when we do not include this

433
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:38,464
emotions and behaviors do not tell a full story  

434
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:40,501
we assume that 

435
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,926
oh well we avoid anxiety right  

436
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:45,251
when we fear

437
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:46,964
we're always isolating

438
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:47,517
 no

439
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:52,651
fear can have a very positive impact on you 

440
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,915
but you have to consider where it came from

441
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,960
 it's the thought  

442
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,817
no you shouldn't officer

443
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,851
right you're an officer of the law

444
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:05,284
fear is stimulating a very positive set of behaviors here 

445
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,371
and I love that the game does this

446
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:09,351
 because it demonstrates this 

447
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:13,651
so much with so much like effectiveness

448
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:15,117
right because

449
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:18,017
like I said

450
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:20,084
it's very easy to look at our behaviors and say yeah

451
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:23,217
like I ordered junk food yesterday

452
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:27,217
I canceled my appointments

453
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:29,017
I bailed on my friend

454
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:31,217
these are all behaviors what were you feeling

455
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:33,951
well I guess I was feeling

456
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:36,690
shame

457
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:39,717
 okay but

458
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:43,751
what's the thought what did you think of before

459
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:47,684
you felt shame and before you cancelled on your friend 

460
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:50,251
well my thought was

461
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:52,484
they don't want to hang out with me anyways

462
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:57,284
okay now we can actually like do some rewiring here right 

463
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:58,717
what's behind that

464
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:02,317
why is there a connection between like

465
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:07,517
I don't think that they want to hang out with me

466
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:09,451
shame and avoidance

467
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,751
and this is where you actually get into

468
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,217
what's behind this whole thing

469
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:17,617
this is cognitive behavioral therapy right 

470
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:18,684
is

471
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,217
thoughts where do they come from

472
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:22,751
they're automatic

473
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:24,051
meaning that like

474
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:27,251
not all thoughts are automatic obviously

475
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:28,602
but like the ones that are intruding 

476
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,651
into our character's mind are very automatic 

477
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,951
and many of ours are as well

478
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:37,417
but most of these thoughts they come from our core beliefs 

479
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,817
this is like the hidden category that's

480
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:44,484
way down deep

481
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:48,351
that is where our thoughts like sort of

482
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:52,651
we don't always have the ability to get insight into

483
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:54,217
what our core beliefs are

484
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,051
this is not core values

485
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:58,451
like I can tell you my core value is like

486
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:02,051
you know respect the law

487
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:03,751
live an honest life

488
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,088
treat people with kindness whatever 

489
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,935
 these are core values  

490
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,617
but a core belief something that might

491
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:13,351
develop into an automatic thought like

492
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:16,284
they don't want to hang out with me anyways is

493
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:17,517
you know like

494
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,884
I'm worthless right

495
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:25,151
or I'm uninteresting 

496
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:27,884
I'm not a good person right

497
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:28,684
a lot of

498
00:25:28,717 --> 00:25:32,117
we can change these and develop positive core beliefs

499
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:34,217
but when we're having this

500
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:39,051
negative translation

501
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,484
thoughts behaviors

502
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:43,117
thoughts emotions behaviors it's coming from like a

503
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:45,317
core belief that is

504
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,751
maladaptive core belief right

505
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,551
and it's all on the word here right maladaptive

506
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,821
think of how many words have this prefix

507
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:00,017
 malice

508
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,851
malicious

509
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:06,717
malfunction

510
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:11,417
malfeasance

511
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:14,017
um

512
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:17,651
malignance

513
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:21,717
malnourished

514
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:28,017
right mal- being like a

515
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:32,151
oh it's a French word it means bad right

516
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:36,951
so when something is bad and adaptive  

517
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:39,884
like we are adapting to it in a negative way 

518
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:44,717
like our brain our emotions they have learned to develop 

519
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:49,617
like in a negative way a maladaptive way 

520
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:53,684
which results in this unproductive 

521
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:56,251
unhelpful chain of thoughts and motions behaviors

522
00:26:56,251 --> 00:27:01,017
and it completely dictates most of what we're doing all the time 

523
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:02,684
and this game is like perfectly

524
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:04,417
depicting this whole thing

525
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:09,549
by suddenly having random thoughts

526
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:11,417
 that come to your mind like this 

527
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,817
but that come from different angles

528
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:18,684
it's fascinating

529
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:26,035
so we're trying to understand 

530
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:32,977
what sort of behavior our character might have as a result of this   

531
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:35,585
because we're currently lacking the insight to 

532
00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:37,284
go all the way into this 

533
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:40,251
you can imagine that especially when you

534
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:47,717
this is hard to do when you are in possession of all of your 

535
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:50,084
critical faculties and you're completely sober

536
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:54,251
and you even have let's say a good grounding of mental health 

537
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:55,484
this is hard to do

538
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:02,866
but this is like why CBT is so effective 

539
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:07,463
 because like it is a practice proven method 

540
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:11,195
 and it is like so crossculturally validated  

541
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:13,451
like this is it this is how it works right 

542
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:18,951
I do not practice CBT religiously

543
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:21,751
it's foundational to a lot of the stuff that I do

544
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:24,451
but I put these more in a narrative context right

545
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:28,217
a lot of my work is focused in

546
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:32,717
narrative psychology

547
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:38,117
which is using similar ideas

548
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,884
but it's asking about them in a very different way

549
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:41,717
so like

550
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:46,017
you know that person doesn't want to hang out with me

551
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,217
instead of like going and using the language of CBT 

552
00:28:49,217 --> 00:28:52,484
we might ask a question like where did you learn that 

553
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,117
how did that storyline start

554
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,751
that they don't want to hang out with you

555
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,684
how did the storyline start

556
00:28:58,251 --> 00:29:00,617
that a good officer of the law

557
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:03,217
is not someone who confronts people that way

558
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:06,451
where does that narrative begin right

559
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:09,817
and how do we start investigating that storyline

560
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,593
so it's just using a different sort of 

561
00:29:11,593 --> 00:29:14,422
verbal framework to address things 

562
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:19,351
in a way that's a little less like clinical jargony

563
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:27,417
this is what's so great about this game

564
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:33,251
and like I said

565
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:36,617
imagine you're in full possession of your critical faculties 

566
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:38,616
you're sober you're mentally well person  

567
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,284
this is still complicated

568
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:44,093
but now imagine you're also fiending for a cigarette 

569
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:48,733
 imagine you're looking for ways to get a buzz  

570
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:50,717
imagine you are buzzed right

571
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:54,102
trying to detect and trace these things 

572
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:58,417
 and like sort out what you're thinking what you're feeling 

573
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:01,817
how this results in behaviors and patterns of behaviors is 

574
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:03,751
like it's really really hard

575
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:08,217
so that's why as a substance use

576
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:10,583
working in substance use

577
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:18,525
 a lot of my work is in helping people to identify these things  

578
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:23,917
 and learning to do this without self judgment right 

579
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,851
because we can't come into this and say like

580
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:27,917
oh well I just realized that

581
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:32,617
I tend to confront people very negatively

582
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:36,360
because I've associated good feelings with

583
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:41,451
you know being vulgar and confronting people right

584
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:44,617
and getting relief from telling people to fuck off

585
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,851
I get a release of my anger that way

586
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,651
wow I must be a bad person

587
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:50,351
oh

588
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:52,917
there's another thought right

589
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:58,051
like you're able to put it back on the board

590
00:30:58,051 --> 00:31:01,151
and look at these things without judgment right 

591
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:06,834
and as you do that you may start to develop that core self empathy 

592
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:12,188
because then you can learn that 

593
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:14,651
look my thoughts I'm not in control of these things 

594
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:17,551
they just they happen automatically a lot of times

595
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,251
and when I do change my core beliefs

596
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:21,551
I can change my thinking

597
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,117
I can change the way I respond to emotions

598
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:25,951
my behavior will follow suit

599
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:30,551
and I will have the language to tell a better story 

600
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:32,217
about what is happening in my life

601
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,851
that's how you do psychology

602
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:42,888
okay I've been going

603
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:44,851
I'm going on a rant here for a while

604
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:46,417
I'm gonna read some of your

605
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:47,951
some of your comments

606
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:58,051
Brady is there any chance to work with you

607
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:01,710
I think I'll learn more with you than any institute here 

608
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,051
 I'm very humbled by that

609
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:07,449
well this is what I can offer you at the moment 

610
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:12,517
 is just my janky whiteboard scribbles and 

611
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:18,446
semi game playing semi self therapy lesson 

612
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:20,517
but I hope it's helpful to someone

613
00:32:35,317 --> 00:32:36,717
half flight is your fight or flight

614
00:32:36,717 --> 00:32:38,551
volition is your self control and dignity 

615
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:40,051
yeah no I think that

616
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:44,017
the names that the game gives to these sources

617
00:32:44,017 --> 00:32:46,376
that's why I was so compelled by

618
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:48,407
 this idea right when I at the beginning  

619
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:51,251
because like as I said in my first like little 

620
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:53,551
breakaway analysis I was like yeah

621
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:58,198
I struggle sometimes to explain to people  

622
00:32:58,198 --> 00:33:01,234
that you can have multiple mental states that

623
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:02,441
compete with each other

624
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:07,617
 for like delivering this thought emotion behavior mechanism  

625
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:08,417
it's like

626
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:12,417
imagine this was the language we use to say like

627
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,317
what is volition telling you right now

628
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,684
if you're feeling your life dominated by thoughts of electrochemistry 

629
00:33:18,717 --> 00:33:21,817
what do you think volition would say against them right

630
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:24,951
you could like legitimately use that dialog

631
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:31,807
when I was in therapy

632
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:34,304
CBT felt like such an unsubstantial practice  

633
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,050
because it was never explained like this

634
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,607
well that's part of the problem I think

635
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,874
is just that like CBT works

636
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:43,541
it does it's not perfect for everything

637
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:46,207
but as a good foundation for

638
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:50,507
seeing short term results

639
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:55,674
like you can see people start to make effective changes very quickly 

640
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:57,874
and CBT's whole goal is teaching the

641
00:33:57,874 --> 00:33:59,641
client to become their own therapist

642
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:01,707
because when you're equipped with this

643
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,933
knowledge you can start doing this

644
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:04,507
 you can start

645
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:10,732
literally just start with this chain right thought emotion behavior  

646
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:12,274
and start writing them down

647
00:34:12,274 --> 00:34:12,741
you know

648
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,441
that's why like we're often recommending doing

649
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:16,241
thought records and things like that

650
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:20,268
but work your way back herewards look at the behavior

651
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,301
what did you do

652
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:25,034
when my mom called I let the phone go to the voicemail

653
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:26,568
what were you feeling

654
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:28,268
I was feeling fear

655
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,983
what was the thought attached to it

656
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:33,850
I was afraid that I was in trouble for something

657
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:34,916
okay

658
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,816
keep doing that

659
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,850
what's the pattern right like you you

660
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:42,716
you can start doing this it's um

661
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,916
it's really impactful

662
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:54,807
if we're stopping like this every time electrochemistry tells us to do it 

663
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:56,274
we are here for another half year

664
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:57,074
yeah I know

665
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:00,607
I told you I try not to

666
00:35:02,107 --> 00:35:03,274
I could be

667
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:05,941
I could literally do this like for a very long time

668
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:08,307
because I enjoy it

669
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,383
so thought cabinet ideas could be more

670
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:14,250
like those narratives inform how we express ourselves

671
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,516
yeah what I'm thinking about

672
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:17,550
thought cabinet is basically like

673
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:25,257
this is kind of like stepping back from the thought 

674
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:26,880
and getting into a core belief  

675
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,814
like exploring a core belief

676
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,647
once I have discovered that my core belief

677
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,480
or one of them might be

678
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:36,017
I'm sorry

679
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:38,851
right my core belief might be attached to this

680
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:45,139
the internalization of that is like me starting to examine the evidence 

681
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,149
 that's a very CBT

682
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:53,234
framework as well

683
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:54,634
examining the evidence

684
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,634
it's basically like a Socratic questioning sort of thing 

685
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:03,901
how did you learn that this was true

686
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:06,501
how did you learn that you are a worthless person

687
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:11,434
how did you learn that people don't want to spend time with you

688
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,934
what is the evidence that tells you that's true

689
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,559
well I don't go out very much

690
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,325
I don't have a lot of friends

691
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:20,859
I don't get invited to things

692
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:24,859
okay well what's the evidence that counters that

693
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,759
well let's look in your phone

694
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:29,125
how many phone calls do you have

695
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,959
well I have a lot but I didn't pick them up

696
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,639
why 

697
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,725
well because I was afraid

698
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:33,559
oh okay

699
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,743
well then that there's not so much evidence for this right  

700
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:38,674
so examining the evidence

701
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:41,241
when we're internalizing a thought

702
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,607
that's kind of what we're doing

703
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:47,882
we're looking for ways to either reinforce or

704
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:52,307
counteract the idea that this is a core belief

705
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:54,674
and that's what so brilliant about this

706
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:57,341
is that you can decide after you internalize this

707
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,674
that you can get rid of the thought like

708
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,507
okay well I've discovered that

709
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:04,412
through no fault of my own 

710
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:07,057
through a process of maladaptive thinking  

711
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:09,641
I have developed a negative core belief 

712
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:11,707
and I want to change that core belief

713
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,749
I don't want to be a confrontationalist 

714
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:19,041
I want to be an apologist or something 

715
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:21,474
could be like that

716
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:30,544
I don't know how much you've brought up about CBT in this playthrough 

717
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:33,496
but a narrow CBT focus analysis of discolysium

718
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:35,248
we wouldn't run out of things

719
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:36,562
well this is the first time I brought up CBT

720
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,996
probably not only on this game but like

721
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:41,996
even in this whole channel

722
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:44,120
like I really don't bring up CBT a lot

723
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,729
 because again narrative fits my framework a little better 

724
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:48,696
for stuff like this

725
00:37:48,696 --> 00:37:54,196
but this game is nailing CBT how it works 

726
00:38:00,162 --> 00:38:03,566
I just completed my Masters in psychology for a 3 months ago 

727
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:04,896
 but they never explained CBT like that

728
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:05,696
I love that

729
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,728
I suffered from depression for 10 years

730
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:20,482
went to many mental health specialists 

731
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:26,695
and these analysis are better than psychologists told me 

732
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,577
yeah I mean the way I think about medication is

733
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,377
like there are definitely aspects of mental health that 

734
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:38,943
that medical intervention are great for

735
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,043
especially for talking like depression right like

736
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:45,286
I will often let people know that 

737
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:48,551
look much of the work that we can do in therapy 

738
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:51,118
that can benefit by doing a process like this 

739
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,685
let me get rid of some of these circles

740
00:38:58,014 --> 00:39:01,014
the thing is we can critically evaluate a lot of this stuff 

741
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:02,580
and that's great

742
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:05,247
but it's really hard to do

743
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,196
when you have fundamental parts of your biochemistry that are 

744
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,380
currently compromised by depression right

745
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:18,976
remember what I said about the nervous system

746
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:20,976
like when you are depressed

747
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,600
and alcohol is a depressant

748
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,098
but we can naturally become depressed without alcohol 

749
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,852
we're fatigued we're tired

750
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:34,687
it takes a lot of mental effort to listen to things like volition 

751
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:36,554
which tell us to make our bed

752
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:41,026
and get up in the morning and go have a social encounter  

753
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:44,810
and like do all these things that are objectively good for you 

754
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,640
 but they take a lot of energy

755
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:51,431
and so medication can for example like

756
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:54,897
just clear out some of that fog and

757
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:57,474
it's not gonna cure depression

758
00:39:57,474 --> 00:39:59,807
but what it can do is it can prime you to

759
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,141
actually benefit from this process right

760
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:07,501
you're not gonna benefit from this if

761
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:12,322
it's a struggle just to get through a 45 minute conversation 

762
00:40:12,622 --> 00:40:16,294
you're not gonna be able to do the kind of rigorous self critique

763
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:19,422
that like I'm asking of you as your therapist right 

764
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:24,219
what we need is someone who is able to sort of

765
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:26,452
grapple with these subjects

766
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:28,009
integrate this feedback 

767
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:33,671
actually follow through with the tasks that we are in pursuit of therapeutically 

768
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:35,186
 to actually make progress

769
00:40:35,252 --> 00:40:38,219
and so like medication can help prime you for that

770
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:48,951
rigorous self critique

771
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,151
yeah I love that I actually do love that

772
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:54,744
some medication help 

773
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,834
but I still feel like I need good non medication therapy 

774
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:59,934
no yeah you need both right

775
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:04,115
I mean it's my belief that both are

776
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:10,161
they're cooperative in the process of this right

777
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:14,468
some medications can do the bulk of the work 

778
00:41:15,234 --> 00:41:18,768
but a lot of them are treating symptomology right

779
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:22,022
especially when we're talking about addiction

780
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,145
for example 

781
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:27,488
someone stop me at any time and say play the fucking game 

782
00:41:27,922 --> 00:41:29,155
as well because like

783
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:34,288
I will just keep talking if if not stopped

784
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:42,592
medications that are designed to help people through addiction 

785
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:45,495
for example medications that like

786
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:49,840
if the person is taking opiates 

787
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:57,051
we're talking heroine fentanyl these sorts of things right 

788
00:41:57,051 --> 00:42:03,114
like your brain has opiate receptors that crave intake 

789
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:09,943
 and certain medications can basically just park in that receptor 

790
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,020
and so the body is like okay well there is something 

791
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,617
taking up that slot 

792
00:42:18,076 --> 00:42:19,991
it's not all the way there

793
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:24,791
 but like even if you were to try to smoke a fentanyl pill 

794
00:42:25,283 --> 00:42:29,083
that medication is already parking in the spot for the receptor 

795
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,301
so there's a good chance that 

796
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:32,161
that person's not even gonna get high from it   

797
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:35,017
and that's gonna reduce the sense of craving

798
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:38,088
it's going to reduce the kinds of like fucked up

799
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,953
damage that does to this whole process

800
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:42,488
 and the person is

801
00:42:42,622 --> 00:42:45,988
eventually with medication and therapy

802
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:48,888
and peer support and all kinds of other good stuff

803
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:52,707
going to find that their impulses to use

804
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:57,041
no longer hijack the healthy operation of this network

805
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:01,776
so medication is good too

806
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,586
with the right understanding and intention

807
00:43:20,568 --> 00:43:22,168
we haven't done drugs yet in the game

808
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:24,868
but they give you a bonus to the whole stat line

809
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:28,834
but that's only temporarying comes off with other side effects yeah 

810
00:43:33,941 --> 00:43:36,274
yeah I if I could like

811
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:41,841
do a breakdown of every single encounter in this game

812
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:44,941
I would I would but we would never finish it so

813
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:46,941
let's continue

814
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,207
but now we understand why this is happening

815
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:55,841
this two lines of dialogue

816
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:59,986
so let's ground ourselves back in this okay

817
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:01,913
now that we have like a very

818
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:04,853
 basic understanding of the cognitive model 

819
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:09,153
and the way that drugs are currently

820
00:44:09,153 --> 00:44:11,753
impairing and in fact causing this problem

821
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:17,186
what kind of behaviors do we think are going to happen 

822
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,255
there's a difference between what I want to say here  

823
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:21,925
and what I think my character would say here 

824
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,925
so let's get Kim involved

825
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:30,314
Kim I think I should tell people to fuck off more often

826
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:31,680
it felt really good

827
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,713
fuck yeah motherfuckers 

828
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,314
it's not really my style

829
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,480
we're going with it's not really my style

830
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,247
because we are starting to develop

831
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,600
more into our core belief that we are sorry we're apologetic 

832
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,650
we find that that our behaviors

833
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:53,775
our behavior of telling people to fuck off right 

834
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:57,258
this right here this confrontational 

835
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:01,216
it's coming from giving us a sense of relief

836
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:02,533
 and getting rid of shame 

837
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:06,650
but we're starting to not like this about ourselves just like

838
00:45:07,516 --> 00:45:10,566
I as a person do not like that I get defensive

839
00:45:12,341 --> 00:45:15,000
which I you know I admit frequently like 

840
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,022
I don't like that my first reaction 

841
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:19,375
is often defensiveness and avoidance  

842
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,441
but you know I understand that's

843
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:26,341
that's a behavioral result of feeling insecure and that

844
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,375
you know the core belief is like

845
00:45:32,175 --> 00:45:33,608
people don't like me or something

846
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,175
so

847
00:45:38,475 --> 00:45:42,400
sorry cop is finding the confrontation 

848
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,934
and the avoidance of shame through relief about confronting people

849
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:46,675
 does not 

850
00:45:46,808 --> 00:45:49,550
it's not good for us 

851
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,941
we're trying to learn a better way to get relief

852
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,324
without it having to replace shame 

853
00:45:55,324 --> 00:45:59,075
and resulting in worse social circumstances 

854
00:46:00,775 --> 00:46:01,575
so

855
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,691
let's explore another route to that 

856
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:05,925
and say it's not really my style  

857
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:09,874
hey I've got an idea on how to fix your style 

858
00:46:10,408 --> 00:46:12,800
maybe you should just go fuck yourself 

859
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,808
yeah ever thought of that 

860
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,325
yeah I have thought of that half life 

861
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:20,841
but I starting to think that you're my enemy now 

862
00:46:23,141 --> 00:46:25,875
rejected half light rejected

863
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:28,941
and I don't give a fuck if it damages my morale

864
00:46:28,941 --> 00:46:33,008
sometimes you have to go through a process of rupture and repair 

865
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,716
rupture and repair

866
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:37,608
that's healing

867
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,141
let's

868
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:44,841
ooh okay

869
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,725
now that we're sorry cop we can investigate this  

870
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,775
but we're still not there yet

871
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:56,475
what was I doing

872
00:46:59,141 --> 00:47:00,075
what was I doing

873
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,408
I was gonna go see Frittte girl

874
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:11,008
the best character

875
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,975
oh my god this poor thing

876
00:47:16,841 --> 00:47:18,541
is she working still

877
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:22,008
it's nearly 10 PM honey what are you doing here

878
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,941
I was here like in the morning

879
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:28,075
how long is her shift

880
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:37,950
overtime

881
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:51,208
okay

882
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:53,475
here's the thing all right  

883
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:55,175
I want to talk about Frittte girl a little bit

884
00:47:56,525 --> 00:48:00,241
if you allow me to indulge a little bit and like 

885
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:05,675
how would I actually approach therapy with this young woman  

886
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:09,208
who from my perspective

887
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:13,485
spends an inordinate amount of time

888
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:15,875
 doing something that she hates 

889
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:19,941
what do you think that that's going to do to her own self esteem 

890
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:24,675
because I can imagine a lot of her thoughts throughout the day 

891
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:28,675
just being negative ones like this is a waste of time

892
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,341
these people are annoying

893
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,808
I don't like being here

894
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,150
I'm bored 

895
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,175
I don't know

896
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:37,541
I hate this right

897
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:40,237
how many negative thoughts

898
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:42,241
 do you think are crossing through her mind 

899
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:46,775
and how much of her emotion is going to be dominated by like 

900
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:50,441
feelings that ask her to disconnect

901
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:54,075
she may feel moments of sadness

902
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:56,175
she may feel moments of grief

903
00:48:56,241 --> 00:49:01,241
time that she is losing where she could be spending time with friends 

904
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:05,041
where she could be on summer holiday somewhere enjoying life 

905
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:09,775
regret for the decisions made 

906
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:13,625
or the fact that the only way that she sees 

907
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:17,200
to climb out of her economic circumstances

908
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,741
is to work a job that she hates and endure 

909
00:49:20,675 --> 00:49:22,741
living a life where

910
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:30,541
the pipeline of her thoughts are going to be clogged with negativity 

911
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:35,075
how many negative thoughts do you think she's having every single day 

912
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:37,361
because you and I have millions of them

913
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:40,441
 millions constantly right like 

914
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:43,408
thoughts just constantly constantly constantly

915
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:48,275
when you're in environment where every single one is negative like this 

916
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:50,675
okay

917
00:50:00,408 --> 00:50:02,241
this is her world right now okay

918
00:50:02,941 --> 00:50:05,941
how many positive thoughts a day is she having compared to this 

919
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:09,975
like it's an insane amount

920
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,408
and so at the end of the day

921
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:17,975
when she gets her paycheck and she maybe has one good thought  

922
00:50:17,975 --> 00:50:20,808
like hey I can go buy myself something

923
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:25,575
this is not a healthy balance

924
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,875
for someone who is still developing

925
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:33,141
it's not even a healthy balance for someone who is fully developed 

926
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:39,341
like this is what working a shit job that you hate feels like 

927
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:41,441
is you spend all day

928
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:47,008
doing whatever you can not to observe and reflect on the 

929
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:49,975
overwhelming amount of negative thoughts that you're having 

930
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:54,641
and trying to find ways to avoid or suppressed the negative emotions 

931
00:50:54,641 --> 00:50:55,808
for example

932
00:50:56,841 --> 00:51:00,475
spending all her time reading a magazine instead of like working 

933
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:03,941
taking extra breaks while you're working

934
00:51:04,075 --> 00:51:05,541
doing your work slower

935
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:09,541
like we're all looking for ways to avoid

936
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:14,141
the kind of busy work that results in this 

937
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:17,875
especially because the job that she's working is not super demanding 

938
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:20,875
she has to spend a lot of time just hanging around and waiting 

939
00:51:20,941 --> 00:51:25,775
and that makes her vulnerable to actually like hearing these things 

940
00:51:26,175 --> 00:51:30,141
you know if I'm like doing a job where it's like labor or something and 

941
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,850
there's a lot of like menial tasks that I'm doing  

942
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,875
I'm I'm probably not gonna think a lot about this stuff 

943
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:42,075
I'm probably still having them but I'm not vulnerable to the onslaught of them 

944
00:51:43,075 --> 00:51:44,778
but she's sitting here day in day out

945
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:48,408
 for whoever knows how many fucking hours 

946
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:51,299
and she has to observe every 

947
00:51:51,299 --> 00:51:54,841
negative thought that's coming through her mind 

948
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:59,541
and maybe every once in a while a positive one wanders through 

949
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:06,875
but it's not preparing her for like positive emotions right 

950
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:09,575
and what kind of behavior is this going to lead into

951
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:13,641
it's going to lead into being disinterested 

952
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:20,575
right it's going to make her avoidant of conversation

953
00:52:22,075 --> 00:52:23,141
isolation

954
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,665
it's not telling her that this is relaxing 

955
00:52:27,665 --> 00:52:30,025
just because she's not doing anything

956
00:52:30,841 --> 00:52:32,975
it's not telling her that socializing

957
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:36,241
cures her of the awareness of all of this negativity

958
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:43,400
and she's standing all day long  

959
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,725
she is tired she is completely burnt out from this  

960
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:50,131
you can just tell

961
00:52:50,457 --> 00:52:53,808
 from the way that she talks and and the like 

962
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:59,846
the subtextual body language that you can hear there right 

963
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:00,975
so like 

964
00:53:01,975 --> 00:53:04,475
this is not a good life for her it definitely isn't  

965
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:07,341
so like what would I do to help her okay 

966
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,841
again part of this would be trying to explore with her

967
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:19,608
if she can't get out of this situation

968
00:53:19,608 --> 00:53:21,902
then we need to sort of discover something that

969
00:53:21,902 --> 00:53:23,741
 makes this worthwhile for her 

970
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,875
because the meaning of it right now is just

971
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,841
I have to do this because I have no other choice

972
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:33,441
presumably right

973
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:37,775
and so I'm burdened with all these negative thoughts

974
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:39,641
and there's no cure for that

975
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:46,475
I would really want to know what does she want from life right 

976
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:49,941
what would she rather be doing with her time and

977
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:53,975
exploring with her ways that she might

978
00:53:55,941 --> 00:54:02,375
get that same sensation not in her workplace right 

979
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,016
because 

980
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:08,361
the best she can do is just escape into this little book 

981
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:11,041
right this little magazine

982
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,775
but how many times can she read it and not get bored

983
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:18,208
it's so heartbreaking

984
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:23,675
I would ask her like what's going on at home you know

985
00:54:26,608 --> 00:54:29,808
does anyone ask you like what what your day was like

986
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:33,641
and do you speak to them honestly because

987
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:37,875
I I have the feeling that like when she's talking to let's say her parents 

988
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,075
it would be like yeah work was fine

989
00:54:41,008 --> 00:54:43,075
well did anything interesting happen

990
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:44,741
um I don't know right

991
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:47,241
I'm assuming that the parents don't care but maybe they do 

992
00:54:47,475 --> 00:54:50,875
maybe they do and she's just so disaffected that

993
00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:53,641
she doesn't know how to communicate

994
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:56,008
because nothing interesting is happening right

995
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:01,341
she doesn't know how to make this interesting

996
00:55:03,808 --> 00:55:05,475
yeah she might say fine

997
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:08,975
but like fine is the worst thing that you can say therapeutically 

998
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,941
when we say the word fine

999
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,975
what we really mean is we're functional

1000
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:24,325
we are functioning we are standing here 

1001
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:27,441
we are completing the day we are cashing the check 

1002
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,808
we're doing things we're doing behaviors but like

1003
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:34,275
we're just doing behaviors

1004
00:55:34,275 --> 00:55:37,175
we're not having any of the resulting emotions right  

1005
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:40,775
like this word is garbage it's terrible for you 

1006
00:55:41,141 --> 00:55:43,875
it doesn't tell a good story at all 

1007
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,375
and it really limits 

1008
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:50,075
your ability to like search for a solution

1009
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:54,111
what I find fascinating is 

1010
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,641
and I do this a little bit on purpose 

1011
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:00,175
this word is so common

1012
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:05,041
and the English language is so poisoned with 

1013
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:08,975
hey how you doing how's going good 

1014
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,100
all that stuff that like just common small talk that 

1015
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,841
what I'll do sometimes is like 

1016
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:18,808
I'll go get my client and then on the way to the therapy session 

1017
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:21,875
like if I'm pulling them from you know group therapy session  

1018
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:24,008
and I'm going to take them to do individual 

1019
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:26,267
I will ask them 

1020
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,008
while we're on the way 

1021
00:56:28,775 --> 00:56:29,875
so how's your day going

1022
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:33,175
and they'll say you know it's going all right

1023
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:37,441
and then when we get in the session

1024
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:41,341
I'll be like so you know what's going on lately 

1025
00:56:41,341 --> 00:56:43,441
and they're like everything is terrible

1026
00:56:44,841 --> 00:56:46,141
ha I'm like 

1027
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,541
what does this tell you what does this tell you that

1028
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:54,475
when someone asks our immediate response is just to 

1029
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:58,208
navigate that conversation with a common answer

1030
00:56:58,208 --> 00:56:59,775
which is that yeah things are okay 

1031
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:03,575
but then the mask comes off and no things are awful

1032
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,141
it's not considered socially acceptable

1033
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:12,375
so like how many opportunities is this young girl getting 

1034
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:15,275
to actually be honest about how she feels

1035
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:18,875
it's zero

1036
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:21,075
okay

1037
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:24,975
I genuinely want to know

1038
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:34,075
maybe she can try to see her work in a positive light

1039
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,641
like hey these bottles look nice

1040
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:37,275
organizing them is actually fun

1041
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:40,208
but I feel like she'd run out of like

1042
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,425
I love what our guys are doing

1043
00:57:42,941 --> 00:57:43,841
what are we doing

1044
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,473
this poor girl

1045
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:54,075
I love that they're doing this

1046
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:57,208
Kim is helping me out with my back after I sat in that awful chair 

1047
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,175
sport fritter girl is like what the fuck is happening

1048
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:03,675
but hey maybe I'm giving her something interesting to talk about at home for once

1049
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:11,008
so I don't think I would use CBT with Frittte girl

1050
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:14,075
let's see

1051
00:58:19,808 --> 00:58:21,608
so I think that

1052
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,208
the approach that I would use

1053
00:58:28,408 --> 00:58:29,575
would kind of be

1054
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:33,608
something like motivational interviewing

1055
00:58:37,608 --> 00:58:39,500
which is not so much a therapy style 

1056
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,641
as it is a general way of engaging someone  

1057
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:48,808
and sort of like

1058
00:58:49,675 --> 00:58:51,363
because like I'm going off an assumption

1059
00:58:51,363 --> 00:58:53,275
 that she wants something bigger than life

1060
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:57,941
but she probably has not had the platform to explore that subject

1061
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:02,775
I would start asking her questions like

1062
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,341
can you tell me some of your accomplishments

1063
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:10,875
and she'd say I don't know

1064
00:59:12,641 --> 00:59:15,008
what did you make anything recently

1065
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:18,075
did you make a good meal recently

1066
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:19,941
did you read a good book

1067
00:59:21,175 --> 00:59:22,775
did you have a good conversation

1068
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:24,075
right I would be sort of like

1069
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:27,408
asking her to explore

1070
00:59:28,808 --> 00:59:30,275
things that she had completed

1071
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,975
because this feels never ending

1072
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:35,275
it's day in day out same bullshit all day every single day right 

1073
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:36,408
so

1074
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:41,008
nothing feels like it has any markers of progress

1075
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,241
and she'd be like um I don't know I guess right

1076
00:59:47,575 --> 00:59:51,008
so what did it feel like to finish that book

1077
00:59:51,908 --> 00:59:53,375
um it was okay

1078
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:59,875
one thing that really works especially with teenagers

1079
01:00:00,675 --> 01:00:04,275
is like pretending you do not understand this word

1080
01:00:05,141 --> 01:00:08,208
I mean I understand it but like basically like 

1081
01:00:09,175 --> 01:00:13,041
okay well assume I don't know what okay means like

1082
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:15,441
you know can you tell me a different word like

1083
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:16,875
it was cool

1084
01:00:17,941 --> 01:00:21,141
you know I don't know really what cool is anymore these days 

1085
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:23,141
like what are some other things that are cool

1086
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:29,041
um I saw something you know 

1087
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,375
I heard something cool on the radio the other day

1088
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,841
oh okay well what was it

1089
01:00:33,941 --> 01:00:36,025
it was a story about you know  

1090
01:00:36,025 --> 01:00:38,675
a new technological development in this region

1091
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:40,641
so what was so cool about it

1092
01:00:42,408 --> 01:00:46,008
well I don't know it was interesting I hadn't heard it before 

1093
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:48,008
so

1094
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:51,875
what do you feel when you hear something interesting

1095
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,408
like when you learn something new

1096
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,743
um 

1097
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,575
I mean it's nice I guess

1098
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,667
and like I'm picking up on every time that she qualifies something 

1099
01:01:03,183 --> 01:01:06,575
as cool interesting nice

1100
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:11,008
she minimizes it with I guess or I don't know

1101
01:01:11,408 --> 01:01:14,875
and I would start picking up on that pattern right

1102
01:01:16,608 --> 01:01:18,375
you know every time you say

1103
01:01:20,075 --> 01:01:22,375
something good happens I notice you tend to

1104
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,975
minimize it afterwards

1105
01:01:27,275 --> 01:01:29,841
why do you think that you know you tend to do that

1106
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,408
um I don't know

1107
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:39,275
maybe because like I'm not sure about how I feel about it 

1108
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:41,808
and maybe I'm not sure if

1109
01:01:43,675 --> 01:01:45,375
I'm right like

1110
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:47,741
if I say it's interesting and you think it's lame

1111
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:49,075
you're gonna think I'm lame

1112
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:55,875
so what do you think people feel about you generally right 

1113
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:59,141
I would want to know about her life and her world 

1114
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:00,441
and how she sees the world

1115
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:06,000
I feel like she's so detached and so plagued by negative thoughts  

1116
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,241
that she doesn't have the vocabulary to discuss emotions 

1117
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:13,541
I would be trying to get her to discuss things that are cool interesting 

1118
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:16,575
let's expand that what does it mean to be interesting 

1119
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,341
I don't know this word

1120
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:20,441
break it down for me

1121
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:22,675
what does it mean when something is interesting

1122
01:02:22,675 --> 01:02:24,941
well it's fun to learn something new

1123
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:28,608
it's cool that I can share it with someone else

1124
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:32,975
and I feel like they'll feel like it was worthwhile talking to me 

1125
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:34,575
because they learned something new

1126
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:37,175
and suddenly I feel a little less worthless

1127
01:02:37,808 --> 01:02:41,941
wow that's a much deeper story than this was interesting 

1128
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,975
let's build on that

1129
01:02:44,241 --> 01:02:47,741
you just told me a great story about what it was like to feel something good 

1130
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:51,812
and you may have actually done that in a place

1131
01:02:52,818 --> 01:02:59,025
where the rest of your life is on hold paused frozen  

1132
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:03,275
in this fucking dystopia of a clerk shop 

1133
01:03:11,675 --> 01:03:13,175
 Frittte girl

1134
01:03:13,408 --> 01:03:15,041
she's the key to everything wait a second

1135
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,641
okay does she have any new dialogue from

1136
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:22,608
um is this about the questions again

1137
01:03:22,808 --> 01:03:25,175
because I don't really know anything

1138
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:27,641
I'm gonna cry can I

1139
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:29,941
can I just pull her out of here

1140
01:03:33,675 --> 01:03:36,475
she doesn't know anything can you go home please

1141
01:03:37,175 --> 01:03:39,041
when do you get off work go home

1142
01:03:40,575 --> 01:03:42,441
okay let's let's turn in our money

1143
01:03:42,641 --> 01:03:44,808
the tare machine stands in the corner

1144
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:48,941
a sign says "one bottle = 10 cents"

1145
01:03:48,975 --> 01:03:51,041
your bottles clunk into the machine

1146
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:54,041
and the money appears with a satisfying jingle

1147
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:56,175
you're a richer man now

1148
01:03:56,608 --> 01:03:59,275
d'you know what you should do with that money kiddo

1149
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:02,341
you should *buy more alcohol*

1150
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:05,341
enter the endless cycle of consumption

1151
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,441
the thing is is I'm finding my

1152
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:12,175
electrochemistry to wield less power over me 

1153
01:04:12,175 --> 01:04:15,225
the more I get acquainted with volition 

1154
01:04:15,225 --> 01:04:17,208
the more I develop a 

1155
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:24,441
a yearning for Kim's approval

1156
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:31,075
these impulses are starting to influence me a little less  

1157
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:35,541
because they are very much built what my shame is built on 

1158
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:41,608
maybe there is some other dialogue I can ask her

1159
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:43,675
I don't know I'm gonna leave her alone for now

1160
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,408
okay let's go talk to Garte

1161
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:52,408
fuck you

1162
01:04:53,575 --> 01:04:55,341
fucking garbage 

1163
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:57,775
just standing there all day

1164
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:08,541
Lena

1165
01:05:08,975 --> 01:05:11,575
Best the second best character after Frittte girl 

1166
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:14,975
sorry I don't mean to blast you with with flashlight  

1167
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,941
okay can I can I barter with this guy 

1168
01:05:22,575 --> 01:05:23,841
can I help you

1169
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:26,341
so about that money I owe

1170
01:05:26,341 --> 01:05:27,975
yes have you got it

1171
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:28,941
how much do I owe you again

1172
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:33,241
a lot for the room and broken window 100 reál

1173
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:36,341
how the fuck am I supposed to pay that

1174
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,141
let's talk about something else

1175
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:39,023
like what 

1176
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:43,408
I was really enjoying talking about the *money* you owe me 

1177
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:46,675
here's your trash container key

1178
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:49,275
thanks I hope you found what you were looking for

1179
01:05:52,975 --> 01:05:55,084
he doesn't need to know that that's privileged information

1180
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:55,550
 just trash  

1181
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:56,875
as it should be

1182
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:59,441
anyway thank you for returning my key

1183
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:05,341
goodbye

1184
01:06:06,608 --> 01:06:09,375
so what can I like not go to sleep or something

1185
01:06:17,008 --> 01:06:20,575
well kuno is the key to a part of this

1186
01:06:23,241 --> 01:06:24,408
take bribes

1187
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,408
do something else for now

1188
01:06:30,008 --> 01:06:32,341
it's like Elena see what she's got 

1189
01:06:32,341 --> 01:06:33,541
hello again sweetie

1190
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:35,701
ah

1191
01:06:37,475 --> 01:06:39,050
sweeties need money do swedies get money  

1192
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,375
does she have any money for me

1193
01:06:40,941 --> 01:06:44,341
I don't want to pedal her but

1194
01:06:44,341 --> 01:06:45,241
oh sweetie

1195
01:06:45,241 --> 01:06:48,608
I heard your conversation with the manager about your

1196
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:50,875
financial troubles

1197
01:06:51,275 --> 01:06:53,341
when do you get your next paycheck

1198
01:06:53,475 --> 01:06:57,175
if she could this woman would feed and clothe you  

1199
01:06:57,175 --> 01:07:00,341
and every other sad lost person on this earth 

1200
01:07:03,841 --> 01:07:04,341
angel

1201
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:07,241
you've got guns of steel and a chiselled jaw

1202
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:10,375
(somewhere under the bloated alcohol layer)

1203
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:13,241
maybe she'd like to sponsor you

1204
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:20,141
tug on her heart strings

1205
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:22,341
is this exploitative though

1206
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:28,835
I mean I feel like it's in sorry cops 

1207
01:07:30,185 --> 01:07:30,942
character 

1208
01:07:30,942 --> 01:07:32,600
to just be honest  

1209
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,875
that like this is one of the only people that 

1210
01:07:37,175 --> 01:07:40,450
that I feel would not judge me unfairly  

1211
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,175
for just asking for help

1212
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,341
this would be a huge step for my character

1213
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:51,341
because like I said about the apology as a utility 

1214
01:07:52,408 --> 01:07:55,808
we would not want to use it as brute force to manipulate people 

1215
01:07:55,808 --> 01:08:02,541
or to feel that receiving forgiveness is doing the actual work 

1216
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:05,341
we need to apologize

1217
01:08:06,275 --> 01:08:09,208
accept feedback and make meaningful change

1218
01:08:10,808 --> 01:08:12,441
and expect nothing in return

1219
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,375
let's ask for help

1220
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:19,208
we've got a 97 percent chance here

1221
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:22,475
your deportment remains dignified

1222
01:08:22,575 --> 01:08:25,041
as you shed a single manly tear

1223
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:29,575
it isn't easy for me to ask this of anyone

1224
01:08:29,575 --> 01:08:31,275
but I am at the end of my rope

1225
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:33,008
any money you have could help me

1226
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:37,675
I feel like there is a impulse to be prideful

1227
01:08:38,175 --> 01:08:40,541
but like this is huge

1228
01:08:40,975 --> 01:08:45,141
I would be so proud of my client for

1229
01:08:45,675 --> 01:08:47,975
genuinely asking for help when they need it

1230
01:08:48,008 --> 01:08:53,475
rather than looking for unscrupulous means to subvert this responsibility 

1231
01:08:56,141 --> 01:08:57,125
this is good for us 

1232
01:08:57,125 --> 01:09:01,441
sweetie I only have a few cents on me but I 

1233
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:05,675
I could give you this to pawn just to tide you over

1234
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:06,941
no

1235
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:11,575
wonderful he has a pin

1236
01:09:12,808 --> 01:09:14,975
the pin is round and slightly tarnished

1237
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:16,208
oh I guess we can't take it back

1238
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:20,500
three sailboats in bas-relief with the sun hovering over the water behind them  

1239
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,150
a chip to green banner at the bottom reads

1240
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,675
Saint-Batiste Summer'31--Dinghy Races

1241
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:29,800
okay I'm so glad that we can make this up to her  

1242
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,241
because I don't want to

1243
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,575
just cope on this

1244
01:09:34,241 --> 01:09:36,541
I will buy it back for you once I have more money

1245
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:40,241
oh it's not an ancient family heirloom or anything but

1246
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:44,441
I suppose it *would* be nice to get it back

1247
01:09:44,808 --> 01:09:48,341
I will do everything in my power to do it

1248
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:51,341
I hope you are able to palm that old trinket

1249
01:09:52,575 --> 01:09:54,075
okay at least I can give it back

1250
01:09:56,008 --> 01:09:57,008
just want to thank you again

1251
01:09:57,008 --> 01:09:58,341
of course dear

1252
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:01,075
I just wish I could have done more

1253
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:11,175
part of me just wants to give it back and find an honorable way to do this

1254
01:10:11,175 --> 01:10:14,275
I would like to explore other means to collect this money

1255
01:10:14,608 --> 01:10:16,541
and if I can't I will use it but

1256
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:22,208
unusually tasteful pin was produced to

1257
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:25,275
celebrate the Saint-Batiste Summer'31

1258
01:10:26,441 --> 01:10:27,975
oh man this is

1259
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,875
it doesn't have enough

1260
01:10:32,075 --> 01:10:34,475
it's not enough money to cover this

1261
01:10:34,475 --> 01:10:36,541
so I'm just gonna give it back I think

1262
01:10:39,475 --> 01:10:42,841
I mean I guess I can always get it from her if I need it 

1263
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:46,141
I hope you were able to palm that old trinket

1264
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:51,008
no I just can't do it I just can't do it

1265
01:10:53,441 --> 01:10:54,841
I just can't do it

1266
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,408
yeah

1267
01:10:58,408 --> 01:10:59,408
thank you dear

1268
01:11:00,075 --> 01:11:02,808
I confess I am glad to see it again

1269
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,741
I just got in some free experience

1270
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:09,008
even the lieutenant seems happy with this turn of events

1271
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:15,325
solid demonstration of character from us

1272
01:11:15,775 --> 01:11:17,475
we've won some favor with Kim

1273
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,241
now what else sweetie

1274
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:25,641
I couldn't do it Lena sorry 

1275
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:27,175
thank you for watching my video

1276

1282
