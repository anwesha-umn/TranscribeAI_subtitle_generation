1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,485
hello

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:06,190
and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,400
so on today's episode

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,140
we're getting deeper into our different character studies

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,620
and kind of breaking down like the psychological dynamics

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,890
in their dialogue and their relationships

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,200
and everything that represents terms of mental health

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,220
this time I give a lot of focus to two characters in particular

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,400
that we meet on our journey through Revachol

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,552
and one of them that

11
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:29,551
I give kind of like my deepest

12
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,940
psychoanalytical impressions yet

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,660
maybe also my

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,360
most unhinged character analysis thus far as well 

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,631
but it is in service of

16
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:46,480
actually kind of discussing like some important things about

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,437
how the game depicts its world building and

18
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:52,740
what characters do we need to look at

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,250
and in terms of like if we look at the shape of their mental health

20
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,300
this will tell us a lot about

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,807
what it is like to live in this environment

22
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:06,080
with these political systems with these social tensions

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,670
like what is the result of that on the people

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,380
who are actually being brought up in this world

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,100
so emm there's a lot to get into 

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,020
I'm excited to share so

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
let's jump back in

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000
okay let's continue

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,898
so I think the last thing we were doing

30
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:27,733
is kind of investigating our relationship with kim here

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,280
I guess if it's a section of this that I missed

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,807
I guess if it's a section of this that I missed

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,860
ah "cool for" I see what you mean

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
I thought it was something I had to click on

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,050
so let's check out Inland Empire

36
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,880
because that's our main skill and

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,466
I'm finding it very interesting that this was the

38
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,600
primary skill that I chose

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,160
especially because in the last stream

40
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,540
I found myself kind of disagreeing with its intrusions a little more 

41
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,800
it says it's cool for dreamers paranatural investigators and mental creators 

42
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,680
I don't know if i'd call myself paranatural

43
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:11,038
but I am an investigator

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,878
and I am a mental creator meaning that

45
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,233
I tend to make stuff in my brain

46
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,560
that's better than I can make it in reality

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,180
empathy is cool for judges of character interviewers interrogators 

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,140
that's me as well

49
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
volition is cool for sane people

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,580
well-adjusted cops

51
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,360
the non-suicidal

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,440
that's kind of half of us right

53
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,750
authority is cool for leaders

54
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,890
experts of psychologIical warfare

55
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,220
and respect junkies

56
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,240
yes yes and yes

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,532
this one is cool for cops

58
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,972
cop aficionados

59
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,140
and pretend cops

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,350
I feel like that last one is us the pretend cop

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,200
suggestion is cool for diplomats charmers and sociopaths 

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,100
who is a shivers cool for

63
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,180
city lovers the wisest of the streetwise the generally supernatural 

64
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,070
well I do think that this has been a pretty relevant skill

65
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,500
to spec into because

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
like more so than anyone else

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,120
the...the city is a main character in this adventure

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,380
and so is our personal relationship with it right

69
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,191
oh is there is there a typo

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,380
oh yeah suicid*i*al

71
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,520
visual calculus for forensic scientists

72
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,533
actical fighters and math-minded people

73
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,323
that's why my guy is so bad at it

74
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:49,920
this one's cool for acrobatics thieves and unbearable show-offs 

75
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,970
I find it more fascinating the stuff that

76
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:55,180
who it's cool for that I'm not good at

77
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,970
electrochemistry it's cool for high-fliers

78
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,520
party enthusiasts cops who need lightning 

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,490
composure is cool for card players

80
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,820
military fetishists and cool people

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,700
well...cool people

82
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,420
I mean we're kind of trying to be cool

83
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,800
I don't think we're there yet though

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,633
okay something I desperately need to do is like 

85
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,580
some of this shit

86
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,520
because last time we played for like three hours and

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,580
basically only completed one thing

88
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,100
so I'm going to

89
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:32,066
I'm going to pick this and go do it

90
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,440
following electrochemistry to try to find cigarettes

91
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,240
has only led me down paths of major distraction

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,660
this is like a passive quest

93
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,680
I'll find one when I find one

94
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:48,300
I'm also on a time limit wait what

95
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:50,612
are you serious

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,200
so I actually like

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,538
my play

98
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,020
the way I play this game is like harming my chances here 

99
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,180
oh it's generous

100
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,200
okay I was about to freak out

101
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,420
because like I'm gonna play this very slowly

102
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,220
generally

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,350
they're still on day one okay

104
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,710
you see how reactive I was to that

105
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,380
I do not like being limited by time

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,872
it's one of my greatest fears in

107
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,140
gaming and in life

108
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,200
it's a couple of days okay

109
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,560
we've got to we've got to focus

110
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,660
there's too many things I have to do

111
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,250
enter the harbor and

112
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,727
seek an audience with the local debaudeur's union leader

113
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:40,960
Evrart Claier

114
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,620
you need to ask him about the murder in his district

115
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,900
okay that's what I gotta do

116
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,760
I gotta go to the harbor

117
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,900
I will not get distracted

118
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,220
on the way there

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,911
I’m not getting distracted by that sad lonely

120
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:56,820
bookish girl

121
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,120
oh what's this guy up to

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,160
I don't think i've talked to him yet

123
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,966
better watch your

124
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,200
better mouth your watch' around me boy

125
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,333
oh he's drunk

126
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,500
he's got a bag!

127
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,758
I seem to be able to get

128
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:13,920
I can collect trash with this bag

129
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,484
how do i

130
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,953
yes okay

131
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:22,240
now I can pick up trash

132
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,741
look how many bottles there are I can 

133
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,400
ah fucking I'm

134
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
I'm so close to getting those cigs now

135
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,865
just you watch

136
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,920
I know I said I wasn't gonna get distracted but

137
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:38,980
but what I meant was

138
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm gonna I'm not gonna get distracted by

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,180
low opportunity cost things

140
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,720
right now I have a high opportunity cost

141
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,700
because I now have a bag

142
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,680
to pick up tare which I learned as trash

143
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,700
some great tectonic forces correct the pavement

144
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,800
like an egg shell

145
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,780
that it has

146
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,621
there's there's something under there

147
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,200
look at all this fucking environmentalism I'm doing now 

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,080
what are these guys doing

149
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,340
build a solid routine and stick to it that's all there is 

150
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,040
it's quite the world view you've got there buddy

151
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,436
whining about your back

152
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:25,100
every time you bring out the measuring taple

153
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,540
emm maybe

154
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,400
let me increase the volume here

155
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,700
rene you're a man with a fork in a world of soup 

156
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,040
please

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,860
let's just try to enjoy the game alright

158
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,740
he's speaking directly to me now

159
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,140
but the other one is eating a big sandwich

160
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm trying to but you keep breaking my concentration

161
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
oh my god

162
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,300
you're old I can see that

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
we're both old

164
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,800
now stop grabbing your ass like it's a girl

165
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,160
these manly men are playing balls

166
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,143
this is a ball game

167
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,120
grab a ball and play it

168
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,320
don't ask questions

169
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,080
shoot first

170
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,900
ask questions never

171
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,351
emm I don't know

172
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:20,780
I'm very comfortable asking questions

173
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,690
especially after my character is starting to

174
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,880
open up a little bit more

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,180
no you got this

176
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,300
there's the ball

177
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
you're the game

178
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,940
these are intrusive thoughts

179
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,800
but I do have a very high chance of succeeding

180
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm gonna observe them first

181
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,060
see

182
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:52,320
your munching and complaining have ruined my concentration 

183
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,940
the man throws a metal ball towards a smaller wooden ball in the sand 

184
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,640
ah *mon dieu*

185
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,320
the pain in my back is unbearable

186
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,620
I can't even say if it's in my back or hip anymore 

187
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,600
feels like it's in both

188
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,700
he tries to measure the throw

189
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,131
I hope you pass out from it

190
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,340
you god damn jellyfish

191
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,892
men like you are the reason

192
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,360
this nation is sinking

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,058
standing tall and proud

194
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,520
he looks at his partner with disgust

195
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,553
shush ignore them

196
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,060
they don't know what they're doing

197
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,980
they're *old*

198
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,880
you are letting down yourself and the team

199
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,600
get in the damn game already

200
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,240
man

201
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,726
the physical instrument is

202
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:37,000
extremely demanding of me right now

203
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,733
I'm gonna ask it to clarify

204
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,000
does it matter what team

205
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,580
pick a team

206
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,660
any team

207
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,020
the blue team

208
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,300
you're letting them down

209
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
get in the game

210
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
and throw the god damn ball

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,622
so it is interesting that it's

212
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:57,760
trying to tap into my sense of physical shame right

213
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,240
which I can imagine from my character is probably quite high

214
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,737
especially because we haven't even looked at our own face

215
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,920
in the mirror yet

216
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,560
partially because I'm imagining we're afraid to perceive ourselves

217
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,165
but we're also very concerned

218
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,800
how other people are perceiving us right

219
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:21,566
that's a profile that I'm starting to develop about him

220
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,700
we were concerned about the way that cuno sees us

221
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,240
in fact we're like trying to rectify that as we speak

222
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,620
we're concerned very much about how kim sees us 

223
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,400
we're sort of not sure where he stands

224
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,100
we were surprised

225
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,700
that lena the woman in the wheelchair

226
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,860
did not make very swift judgments of us

227
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,460
in fact she was kind of like

228
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,880
quite complimentary of us

229
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,560
so like other people's perceptions of raphael

230
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,333
are very important to him

231
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,802
which is why I imagine physical instrument

232
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,713
being so intrusive and like

233
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,380
think of the virtues it's trying to tap into

234
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,796
it said like

235
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:07,240
make a decision without hesitation right

236
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,554
like it's kind of building the association that

237
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:12,040
hesitation is attached to shamefulness

238
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,726
like that if you are indecisive

239
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:16,451
you are weak right

240
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,460
and as a therapist I like

241
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,933
pick up on those things as I'm talking to people

242
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,260
like let's say that my client was like

243
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,000
as soon as I saw the guy talking to my ex-girlfriend

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I went up to him and I got in an argument right and

245
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,540
like that's something that I hear quite often

246
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:39,740
that's where I like dive into

247
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,229
and I'm like okay well

248
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:43,495
what about

249
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,686
being decisive has

250
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:48,580
gotten attached to the idea that that's a show of strength for you

251
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,724
and

252
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,716
is decisiveness more important than

253
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:53,820
making good moral decisions

254
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,260
and in a logical sense no it's not

255
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,662
but in an emotional sense

256
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:00,520
that's often what we're chasing

257
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,180
we're concerned about how to get rid of anxiety

258
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,440
and you know not feel like upset 

259
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,820
rather than making the best all-around decisions

260
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,400
and so we chase things like shame

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,500
we chase things like anger

262
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,263
we chase

263
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,780
the more impulsive emotional reactions

264
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,660
I love that every single person who has played disco elysium

265
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,207
wanted in one way or another to impress kim or him

266
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,528
for him to like or respect them

267
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,639
yeah I can tell that

268
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,610
like he's someone that we are trying to impress and respect

269
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,899
but we're also trying to understand whether

270
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,990
he's just with us because he needs us

271
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,520
why are you so mean to me physical instrument?

272
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,360
eyes on the ball dinky winky!

273
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,460
look it's trying to shame me

274
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,880
it's trying to make me feel small and inadequate

275
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,400
I'll show it and them

276
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,624
wait wait

277
00:12:58,966 --> 00:12:59,766
wait my

278
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,580
my my chances got worse

279
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,120
was it 72% before

280
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,800
okay that's fascinating

281
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,140
so when I was being decisive without hesitation 

282
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,880
my chances were better

283
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,880
but when physical instrument came in to shame me

284
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
and make me feel inadequate

285
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,366
my chances have gotten worse

286
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,800
oh shit that's really interesting

287
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,640
that's very similar to when I was talking

288
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,930
I was doing the investigation or the autopsy 

289
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,880
and I got like a boost from like Cuno 

290
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,670
saying I was cool or whatever

291
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,860
okay this is fascinating to me in terms of like

292
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,280
the kinds of thoughts you have of the moment

293
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,900
will prime you for your like ability to act on them 

294
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,841
it's a hype yourself type of thing yeah 

295
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,320
so I've actually lowered my chances

296
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,860
I'm starting to feel like yeah I'm not gonna get involved 

297
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,020
I mean is there any reason why I shouldn't

298
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,280
I'll show them how it's done I guess

299
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,000
I need to show myself that I'm capable here

300
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,560
here comes the shame

301
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
this felt wrong

302
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,080
wrong like touching your sister's breast

303
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,800
you threw your sister's breast

304
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
oh fuck

305
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,960
mon dieu*

306
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,756
good job officer

307
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:55,100
that was an excellent throw

308
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,720
I lost my respect

309
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,865
there are no two more harmful words

310
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,760
an athlete can hear than "good job"

311
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,500
and this was downright embarrassing

312
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,300
this is very consistent with my character so far

313
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,480
as any physical exertion we have been swiftly embarrassed

314
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,980
let's investigate that though why did feels so

315
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,660
your muscle memory knew what to do and went for it

316
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,560
but there were gaps

317
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,178
something about it was completely unnatural corrupted 

318
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,551
 your muscle memory knew what to do

319
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:31,400
and you went for it but there were gaps

320
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,530
yeah

321
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,260
gaps you tried to fill with *thinking*

322
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,420
we don't think in sports

323
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,020
we do

324
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,856
well if I'm trying to distance myself from

325
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:44,060
 physical instrument and electrochemistry 

326
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,600
then this is kind of a good outcome

327
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,040
it felt like you were going for a thrust or a lunge

328
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,360
there was definitely going to be jumping

329
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,540
maybe you scored a point but this is a *fiasco*

330
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,200
I thought something way more spectacular was going to happen

331
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,920
the throw is terrible and you know it

332
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,000
no need to mock me

333
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,160
I'll just be a little more earnest

334
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,780
what are you talking about

335
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,040
you just executed a pretty much perfect petanque throw

336
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,900
his tone is full of admiration

337
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,803
how are you ever

338
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:23,140
going to get the office's shit off your nose gaston

339
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,980
or even climb out of his ass

340
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,880
that's just how johnny ball game is extraordinary

341
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,620
I was going for something cool but I screwed it up like always

342
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,640
yeah that fits the narrative

343
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,420
that fits my character's construction of himself

344
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,620
the man in the uniform says nothing

345
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,480
his gaze is fixed on the horizon

346
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,140
maybe he identified with that little statement there

347
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,020
his merry partner is staring at the ground

348
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,340
like he's trying to see right through to the other side

349
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,400
the lieutenant is looing at you

350
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,220
his face is expressionless

351
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,584
do you know anything about the man hanged in the back

352
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,200
yard of whirling in rags

353
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,740
unfortunately I don't

354
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,060
unlike most of the locals

355
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,180
I have no qualms about assisting law enforcement

356
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,840
but this affair has passed me by completely

357
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,800
and most of the locals

358
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,500
in martinaise the union is the law

359
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,180
so can you really blame them

360
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
but you don't have a problem with cops

361
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,500
*cop* is a pejorative term

362
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,880
I don't have a problem with policemen

363
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,440
on the contrary

364
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,420
I admire the effort to bring oder to our streets

365
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,471
so again you don't know anything

366
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,980
if I knew I would not be afraid to tell you

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,600
I simply don't

368
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm an old man not a coward

369
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,280
the daily business of the riff-raft

370
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,020
no longer concerns me

371
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,632
this is a man with a lot of past

372
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,200
but little present

373
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,513
and almost no future

374
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,600
Inland Empire coming in with the wisdom

375
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,000
let's uh let's ask him what they're doing here

376
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,572
yes

377
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:08,120
the terrain here provides an interesting variety to a familiar game

378
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,760
do you know what created it

379
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,220
fire from heavy artillery

380
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,360
okay it's a crater left by artillery fire but why

381
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,020
why what?

382
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,720
why was heavily artillery used

383
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,700
because that's what happens when communards hijack your country

384
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,746
execute your supreme leadership

385
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,320
and turn your capital into a slaughterhouse

386
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,740
you use *heavy ordnance* to clean up your home

387
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,720
okay so this guy has just been pushed

388
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,920
a little bit above his like safe zone in terms of anxiety and

389
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,764
he is starting to disclose 

390
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:42,420
much more  information which is interesting 

391
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,133
did you use artillery fire against them

392
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,200
sadly no

393
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:49,733
it was the foreigners who brought them to their knees

394
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,500
we fought valiantly

395
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,231
too valiantly 

396
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:55,280
so valiantly we got licked

397
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,460
should've fought dirty

398
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,300
like they did with their suicide sex cult propaganda

399
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,100
and *mad anarchist women* strapped to shrapnel bombs

400
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,420
we didn't though and we lacked *caliber*

401
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,060
god bless him

402
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,980
but the suzerain's simply weren't big enough

403
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,680
why shell them here in martinese

404
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,360
good question

405
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,900
because the place is the damn beckhead

406
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,300
had to sofen the commies up first

407
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,181
the beachhead

408
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,954
yes the military-coordinated amphibious

409
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:30,940
 landing to take back Revachol

410
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,000
he finds your lack of historic knowledge troubing

411
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,120
a sigh of mental deterioration in the proceeding generations

412
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,380
that is true

413
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,360
martinaise was used as one of the three footholds in revachol

414
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,540
during operation death blow in '08

415
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,780
the other two are off in stella maris and the delta

416
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,900
so there's a difference between like

417
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,760
informing me for some reason does not make him like excited right

418
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,200
if he was like a historian

419
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,040
and he was happy to inform people

420
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,020
he would not be in any way troubled by like catching me up to speed here

421
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,560
the frustration in his tone

422
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,343
though tells me something very different about

423
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,940
what this history means to him

424
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,200
and that other people don't know it

425
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,360
what it tells me is that he's very concerned that the

426
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,620
(the)effort and cost of life put into this task has not been remembered

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
or is not immediately recognizable by other people

428
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,360
and that makes it feel like it wasn't worth it

429
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
and so for him

430
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,500
he is displacing all of that like historical resentment

431
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,440
was what we fought for actually that meaningful

432
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,852
and he's displacing that into me as someone who is

433
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:51,100
ignorant of the struggle right

434
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,260
so it tells me a lot about him as a person

435
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,160
just in the way that he's saying it

436
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,428
I'll just kind of nod thoughtfully at this

437
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,160
this here is blood ground

438
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,500
where coalition boots first made landfall

439
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,200
and cleaned those rabid dogs out

440
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,740
most likely we're playing petanque on their mangled corpses

441
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,040
okay so it's not just because it's interesting to him

442
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,720
you got old rene going there

443
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,200
like he isn't angry enouth already

444
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,040
but that's a line of questioning that I would definitely use in therapy right 

445
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,732
and I've done counseling with

446
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:36,280
people of all kinds of different ages and backgrounds

447
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,980
and for someone who may be a bit older

448
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,720
they have had a longer amount of time living to collect anger

449
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,300
that has not been put into something productive right

450
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,276
what I always kind of start with in that sense is like  

451
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:56,820
what was it like to tell...

452
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,720
me raphael this information

453
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,660
what were you feeling?

454
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,260
I was feeling frustrated

455
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,680
I was feeling like it was pointless

456
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,460
I was remembering the confusion I felt about how

457
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,920
impactful my decisions were going to be making right

458
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,963
I was feeling scared at the ongoing decay of the society

459
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,420
and people's knowledge of how it started right

460
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,420
like he could tell me all of these things presumably

461
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,740
and my approach with him

462
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,580
would be to say that like well we can't change the past right

463
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,180
we can only change what that information means to us

464
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,440
and you have an opportunity here to inform someone

465
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,487
basically the problem that you're having

466
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,320
is that someone is uninformed about this

467
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,980
so maybe try to get them excited

468
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,240
and inform them in a productive way right

469
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,498
if the reason you're upset is people don't know this history then

470
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,800
share it with them

471
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,592
but when you do it from a place of frustration

472
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:57,560
not only does it

473
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,260
make you get in touch with that resentment

474
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,703
but it also drives the person listening

475
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:04,820
not to want to hear any more of it

476
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,700
which is why I'm kind of like as a character

477
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,933
okay well let's just move on then

478
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,620
because you don't seem very happy to be telling me this 

479
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,220
so like the very situation that's causing you angst

480
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,100
can actually be the therapeutic solution too

481
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,632
it's just kind of how you approach it from your attitude

482
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,920
ah that explains all the war damage

483
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,440
damn right son

484
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,660
they laid the fire of hell on this city before they stormed it

485
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:32,700
and it worked too

486
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,665
the rest of the city got cleaned up

487
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,319
 but Martinaise they keep as a monument

488
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:41,119
and now the union socialists are practically running the place 

489
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:44,240
well it's your own damn fault

490
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,216
you we the coalition revachol

491
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:52,120
whoever you want to blame never finished the job

492
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,733
officially the party never surrendered

493
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,100
of course they still all influence

494
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,520
okay so there's some unfinished business as a part of this too

495
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,660
there's a lack of closure

496
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,360
you don't even begin to truly understand the players of the table

497
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,620
let alone the specific circumstances surrounding the

498
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,900
what do you think

499
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,366
that's how it should be

500
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:19,666
soft socialists paving the way for the *hard*working class to take over

501
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,260
foreign powers cleaned up our mess and now they rule us

502
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,840
this coalition seems quite capable actually

503
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,906
commies just don't understand how money works

504
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,240
*nothing *don't* think I just *do*

505
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:36,840
what do I think

506
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,180
what does my character think about this

507
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,620
he's seeing the world in terms of power dynamics and authority

508
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,280
and the more obscure the source of authority

509
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,800
the easier it is to point to it as the bad guy right

510
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,760
that's why we're often thinking of institutions corporations

511
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,001
like the man

512
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:58,660
 like the more vague  the less specific the enemy

513
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,780
the easier it is to displace all of our issues onto

514
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,280
this is like a like kind of the racism angle

515
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,180
commies just don't understand how money works

516
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,580
I guess I'm going to go with that

517
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,660
no they don't

518
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,100
I'm sorry it had to be the coalition

519
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,980
after eight years of fighting rabbit commies

520
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,240
boiling cats for food and drinking piss in the mountains

521
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,520
cats what the fuck

522
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,230
I would have preferred if the right honorable king

523
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,100
Guillaume returned to Revachol

524
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,560
or even if that damn clown Frissel

525
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
had risen from the grave and led us

526
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,860
sadly that was not the case

527
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,800
this royal failure weighs heavily on him

528
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,056
instead all that is just

529
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:51,400
holy and beautiful inthe world was wiped away 

530
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
and now it's neon signs with toothpasteads everywhere

531
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,720
foreign influence peddling garbage and

532
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,520
stupid music on the radio

533
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,466
this is just what the commies wanted

534
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,040
this was their plan all along

535
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,640
this is what they wanted to replace the role of the southerner with

536
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,340
okay so he's got royal allegiances

537
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:15,520
who was this Frissel

538
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,000
damn Frissel

539
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
he was the king we couldn't protect

540
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,487
the carabineers failed him

541
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:22,780
and the crown

542
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,863
he died in the hands of the *hoipolloi*

543
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:28,980
in a very public execution

544
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,060
you mentioned guillaume

545
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,500
a true king in both blood and mind

546
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,800
led revachol before frissel

547
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,772
he would have been better

548
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:40,440
but the damn commies drove him into exile

549
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,340
what exactly is a sousaraine?

550
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,600
sousaraine is the king

551
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:45,840
has everyone forgotten already

552
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,980
they've forgotten already

553
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,220
what did I just say

554
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,266
what did I just say about how

555
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:56,660
he is contributing to his own internal strive

556
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,295
by seeing it as a chore to inform me

557
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:03,960
of the thing that he is already angry I don't know

558
00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:09,280
dude needs to look in a psychological mirror

559
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,000
soon they will forget everything him too

560
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,500
then he chooses anger over melancholy

561
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,060
see empathy knows

562
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,300
he is choosing

563
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,900
he is choosing to have this

564
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,940
not to feel this way but choosing to act on it this way 

565
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,420
it's no use talking to you

566
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,680
you were still in daddy's balls when it happened

567
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:36,187
when we took our last stand against the fifth

568
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,800
and rode the cavalry straight into gunfire

569
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,240
8 percent

570
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,207
composure legendary

571
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,680
what is it about this old soldier that makes him stand so proud

572
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:54,700
I mean  it's a white check

573
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,200
I guess I don't have any reason not to try it right

574
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,566
let's give it a shot

575
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,606
all you observe

576
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:06,000
is a veteran refusing to let go of the past and his old uniform

577
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
this is not uncommon

578
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,980
this is the uniform of the royal carabineers

579
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,260
in service of frissel the first Guilaume*Le Lion*

580
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,180
and the valiant King Filippe the Fifth before him

581
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:19,801
don't you mean Frissel the Fun

582
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,560
I got used to it I know

583
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,240
I got so used to passing those early difficult checks

584
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,240
I succeeded like three times and that's all I get

585
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,740
now I just fail at everything

586
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,020
*you*do not speak his name craven!

587
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,900
although he was a clown

588
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,320
but he was *our* clown

589
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,140
ours to ridicule and to mourn

590
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,100
I don't think having a another point will make it difference

591
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
because I only score eight

592
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,240
I mean I also got a one on the dice roll

593
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
which is pretty dire

594
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,460
failure is good in this game

595
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,080
there's something he missed

596
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,820
you will get to it don't worry

597
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,980
okay I'll come back to it

598
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,820
wow you work hard

599
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,560
oh I do

600
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,840
oh yes you hustle

601
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,566
you're a provider

602
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,466
it's tough out there  but you keep it real and provide

603
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,260
what hard work do I do exactly

604
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,820
look at youself you're a human pedometer

605
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,921
you must have walked 200000 steps

606
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:40,200
 down craked asphalt mosaic sand

607
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,060
and linoleum after you re-emerged

608
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,180
I guess that's true

609
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,000
that is the sign of a hustler who never gives up

610
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:50,186
the world is harsh and people are evil

611
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:54,533
you didn't make it that way and you won't let it break you

612
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:56,333
you *ride*

613
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,780
I'm not sure I ride

614
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,900
hey Adam Sandler a toe tickler 65

615
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,480
thank you for subscribing with prime I appreciate you

616
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:09,602
it's quite a name you've got there

617
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm not sure I ride

618
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,420
oh you do

619
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,420
you make money you got gills

620
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,666
I don't make any money

621
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,495
meaning those black papers 

622
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,740
with the faces of the innocence on them

623
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,700
you bring in the Franconegroes and the Solas 

624
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,500
it ain't easy but you do it day in and day out

625
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,360
you didn't make the rules but you won't lose

626
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,500
you're a cop and a sprinter and a money printer

627
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,860
no I'm not

628
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,120
sevar fair is a liar

629
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,320
sure sure

630
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,080
and has it been easy

631
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,300
is life easy

632
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:45,040
no

633
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,360
have you *not* gone into cardiac arrest

634
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,778
are you *not* about to have an anxiety attack

635
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:52,540
or shoot yourself in the mouth

636
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,460
but you still hustle 24 seven ride or die

637
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,620
now ask yourself

638
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,340
are you rich

639
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,680
no I'm actually not

640
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,000
that's right

641
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,320
you work harder than anyone

642
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,588
you almost rode yourself to the grave

643
00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:12,720
and you're still practically a hobo

644
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,440
why is that

645
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,340
is it because of that guard guy riding my ass?

646
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,680
the system is broken

647
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,160
there's a market for corrupt cops out there

648
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,066
but the immigrant cops have priced up

649
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,866
fucking taxes man

650
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,566
what does my character really think

651
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,594
part of me wants to think he doesn't have 

652
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:36,460
the self-awareness to realize

653
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,320
that it's many of my own decisions and depression

654
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,280
I go with that

655
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,000
because of the taxes

656
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,282
G-man's got his jam-covered sticky-fingers in your pocket

657
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:48,600
G-man's got his jam-covered sticky-fingers in your pocket

658
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,580
stealing from you every time

659
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,325
you buy sell walk talk fart so much as sneeze

660
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,480
you're a liar savoir fair

661
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,900
every time you wipe your ass

662
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,520
they got their direct and their *indirect modes of taxation*:

663
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,540
sales tax excise duty extraction tax alimony

664
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,060
one tax that doesn't even have a name

665
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,740
plus there's the stuff *people in other countries* pay for

666
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,880
that makes them ask for more money from *you* here

667
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,366
total tax duties add up to

668
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,520
 98% of all your money

669
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,620
no fucking way

670
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,040
I guess I'm a free market fundamentalist now

671
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,920
are you sure that seems like a pretty big number

672
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
this isn't helping me solve my money problem

673
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,920
it's only making me into a free market type

674
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,460
what is the difference between these two responses

675
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,480
this isn't helping me solve my money problem

676
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,300
I should be able to participate freely in the market right

677
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,680
I guess I could opt in

678
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,140
here you go  hustler

679
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,060
fight the righteous fight

680
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,500
free the people

681
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,000
keep it real

682
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,440
keep it street

683
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,000
keep foaming at the mouth *furiously* on the tax issue

684
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,760
okay

685
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,160
sometimes I can't tell if making a good role playing decision

686
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,820
will lead to me locking myself out of a good game mechanic

687
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,820
so I appreciate the help there

688
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,700
I'm not above like saying yes to stuff like that it's just 

689
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,941
I like that the game gives me an option not to

690
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,700
but I wouldn't have realized that

691
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,920
 gates me out of something I could be using

692
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,080
okay

693
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,760
looks like I can internalize that too

694
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,380
if you have a side bitch ideology cooking somewhere

695
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,680
don't sweat it

696
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,199
fighting indirect taxation for the Gossamer State

697
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,000
is compatible with *all* creeds

698
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
it's cool like that

699
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,660
you're a cool anarchist now

700
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,320
unless you don't want to be an anarchist

701
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,020
whatever

702
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,166
stuff this meal ticket in your eye-socket

703
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,916
and let's see if we can steal some *love* back

704
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:03,368
from the robber barons at the customs agency at the *banditos* 

705
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:08,420
and the insulindian financial oversight and competition committee

706
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,440
geez

707
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:09,900
okay

708
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,660
looks like we're looking for a side hustle

709
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,260
we get minus two empathy for that though

710
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,240
fuck that

711
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,720
I don't want that

712
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,100
one thing that I recommend is think about your thoughts

713
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,260
that are directly tied to what your character might say

714
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,460
or can do in the future

715
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,640
that's true

716
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,320
well  but I don't want to lose my empathy

717
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,500
I mean  I guess I could turn it on and turn it off right

718
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:45,133
okay  I need to go to the docks

719
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,100
I've been distracted again

720
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,020
only while the research is going on

721
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,080
makes sense

722
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,560
oh  there's trash everywhere for me

723
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,540
I'm going to get so much cash from this

724
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,840
this is my side hustle right now

725
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:23,100
这条chat说得不对

726
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,660
ohh once I 

727
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,460
am I stuck withe this once I complete it

728
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,740
I do not want that

729
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,900
I do not want to lose my empathy

730
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,720
what's going here

731
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,191
a sturdy metal door 

732
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:45,400
guards the southwest entrance to the apartment building

733
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
it's locked

734
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,200
so it's going to knock

735
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
the door rattles against your knuckles

736
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,180
but there's no response

737
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,460
the door rattles again

738
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,534
but this time 

739
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:59,240
you hear an elderly woman's voice calling out from inside

740
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,260
stop banging on the door

741
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,620
I'm not letting any more strangers inside

742
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,236
the empathy returns after I'm done internalizing

743
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:10,900
or I can forget the thought

744
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,880
okay

745
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,900
I will turn it on while I'm walking around then

746
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,320
but not while I'm in dialogue

747
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,280
who am I speaking to

748
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,340
it doesn't matter who I am

749
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:21,566
now go on get out of here

750
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,620
this is the police

751
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,900
the police

752
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,860
everyone knows the police don't come around *here*

753
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,860
oh  walking around doesn't progress the time okay

754
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,260
I mean  

755
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,740
I just don't think I

756
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,240
it aligns with my character that much to be honest

757
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,320
I'm just going to leave it as it is

758
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,400
no  I already told you

759
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,553
I won't be responsible for any more strangers 

760
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,320
getting into the building

761
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,560
go check the backyard door

762
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,700
maybe someone there will

763
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,340
Kim

764
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,500
let's get Kim involved

765
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,441
tell her to open this door

766
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,041
madam I assure you

767
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,200
we are real police officers

768
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,340
show him show her your badge

769
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,640
there is no reply

770
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,280
just faint sweeping sounds inside

771
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,180
okay

772
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,220
can't get in there

773
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,360
why does it keep giving me a notification

774
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,973
I mean I guess I can have my flashlight out 

775
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:33,720
instead of

776
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,860
the crowbar

777
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,933
didn't that say to

778
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,480
investigate the dock or something

779
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,666
Kim move I need to pick up that trash

780
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,440
no  I don't want to talk to you right now

781
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,466
just trying to get that sweet tear

782
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:10,866
what's up here

783
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:11,906
garden house

784
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,380
chairs

785
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,420
there must be another way into the building

786
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,440
what is this guy

787
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:27,000
you see a young man on a balcony nursing a cigarette

788
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,520
his eyes have been following you for a while

789
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,320
he's got a cigarette he's got a cigarette in his portrait

790
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,380
not looking for any trouble  officer

791
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:41,166
despite his the cold  his shirt hangs on button on his frame

792
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
why are you whispering? it sounds like you're already in trouble

793
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,420
no trouble for me

794
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,220
I just want to know what's going on in here

795
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,000
yeah  why are you whispering that's suspicious

796
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,840
there's no trouble I'm just speaking in a lowered voice

797
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,940
I don't want to be seen talking to the gendarmerie if that's okay

798
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,740
I just want to finish my cigarette

799
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,060
how about you toss one of those bad boys down here

800
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,680
it's the god of cigarettes and youth

801
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,440
ask him if he's got anything to spare

802
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,120
he does already respect my authority here

803
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,200
maybe I can get one of them

804
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,440
apologies  but this is my last one

805
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,220
how is it your last one

806
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,440
everyone has said that to me

807
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,525
I'm starting to not to believe them

808
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:25,820
the god himself has denied you absolution

809
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,500
fuck!

810
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,580
why don't youtoss that one down

811
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,340
I’m not sure that's a good idea

812
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,500
I don't care

813
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,000
I need that cigarette from you

814
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,620
I’m not throwing anything

815
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,620
you're arrested

816
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,320
there's no way you catch that cigarette anyway

817
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,380
fuck

818
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
yes really

819
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,800
don't even try

820
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,660
you'll just embarrass yourself

821
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,040
I don't want to embarrass myself anymore

822
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,680
please don't do that to me

823
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,580
as you wish

824
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,560
okay  well  I need to talk to you anyways

825
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,740
is it really that important

826
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,440
I've been stonewalled at every chance to get a ciggy

827
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,060
like a nervous cat

828
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,380
he keeps stealing looks at the neighboring windows

829
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,740
all right  but make it quick

830
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,766
once I finish this cigarette  I have to run

831
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,560
yeah  your last one right

832
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,900
fucking liar

833
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,060
looks like you've got a good view of the Whirling's backyard

834
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,000
can you tell me anything about the hanging

835
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,840
I can *tell* that you finally got him down

836
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:23,333
thank you

837
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,120
it was quite a disturbing sight

838
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,200
even by Martinaise standards

839
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,100
what were you doing last sunday

840
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,580
yeah  investigate him  Kim

841
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,333
oh 

842
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:33,966
 you already asked me that didn't you

843
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,800
did you?

844
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:38,733
no  not you two

845
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,700
some more muscular type

846
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,040
wait  is there another cop involved

847
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,560
and when did you speak to this more muscular gentleman

848
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,940
last week I don't know look

849
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:53,133
he looks around the courtyard again

850
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:55,380
old patio chairs and dead house planters litter the scene

851
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,860
you didn't answer the question

852
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,560
what were you doing last sunday

853
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,500
yeah what were you up to

854
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,800
I had a friend over

855
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,900
it was my sunday friend

856
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,400
sunday friend

857
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,140
A  *Sunday friend*

858
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,100
how intriguing

859
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,400
makes sense

860
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,040
friends are nice on sunday

861
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,420
you don't have to work

862
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,866
you can just spend time with pals

863
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,820
 watching rugby and drinking beer

864
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:20,520
I guess so

865
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,300
he doesn't reply

866
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,340
gesturing  no  with his cigarette

867
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,600
in the neighboring windows

868
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,520
you can see faint reflections of his silhouette

869
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,360
all from different angles

870
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,213
okay  let's get his name

871
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:40,780
my name my name is Martin Martinaise

872
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,520
are you fucking serious

873
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,400
Martin Martinaise

874
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,040
good local name

875
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,640
let's go with that

876
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,900
yeah he's lying

877
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
you're a liar

878
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
my rhetoric is the stupid part of my brain

879
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,040
no

880
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,920
we won't

881
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,133
I've been

882
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,640
now if you'll excuse me I really need to get going

883
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,480
minus one to bumming cigarette

884
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,315
wait what

885
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,366
I can convince him to s

886
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,600
because I didn't get a cigarette from him

887
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,000
I may not be able to pass this

888
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I mean it's a 72% chance

889
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'll put it on my hobo charms

890
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,400
this is going to be easy

891
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,420
time to bring out your secret charm

892
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,266
tears and begging

893
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:35,886
show him your emotional side

894
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:39,146
throw yourself before his very feet like a dog

895
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,866
what

896
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,566
god damn it

897
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,080
why don't you give me the option to try for 17%

898
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,220
I'm sure I'll fucking succeed at that

899
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:58,266
how embarrassing

900
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:02,933
I got a three and a two on my dice roll

901
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:05,120
and then I didn't get a cigarette  so I

902
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,500
it's tragic

903
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,600
I was one point away

904
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,360
if I had just gotten that cigarette from him

905
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,320
if I had only gotten the ciggy  everything would be fine

906
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,000
this case would be solved

907
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,240
please don't go

908
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,060
I'll stop drinking

909
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,500
I'll take out the trash

910
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,100
what?

911
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,880
oh  there's an ex-relationship at play here for our character

912
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,380
that's how we're feeling

913
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,920
do you want me to cry

914
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,160
no for god's sake I don't want you to cry

915
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:38,326
yes

916
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
listen  I really have to go

917
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,360
oh  yeah

918
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:45,720
send me an extinguished cigarette

919
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,740
ah there it goes

920
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,920
wasted

921
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,733
you would have gotten at least a few good drags out of it

922
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:54,900
now electrochemistry is speaking to me

923
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,400
good luck with the investigation

924
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,700
you fucking

925
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:00,946
I hate this guy

926
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,600
I can't believe it

927
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,320
I never want to see him again

928
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,720
if I didn't ask for the cigarette  okay

929
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,940
he's gone

930
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,660
oh

931
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,740
my perception isn't that bad  Kim

932
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,760
this guy is constantly trying to undermine me

933
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,560
no point in running

934
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,220
tenements like these often have multiple exits

935
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,380
if he doesn't want to talk to us then

936
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,780
he'll know how to hide himself

937
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
so we just give up

938
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,140
he could be a witness

939
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,500
him or his *Sunday friend*

940
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,720
either way  we need to look into that *muscular type*

941
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,360
who's asking about our case

942
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,120
yeah  we do

943
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,280
there has to be a way of getting inside the building

944
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,140
let's go check out the door near the pier again

945
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,200
yeah  yeah

946
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,520
once we follow him in  we can ask around for his apartment

947
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,360
I should have listened kembadog

948
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,380
asking around can sometimes ruin my chances

949
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,660
okay

950
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,100
whatever

951
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,720
I don't want to smoke anyways

952
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,540
I don't care

953
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,080
I got bigger things to do

954
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,620
like pick up trash

955
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:12,566
I can wear this bum hat

956
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,840
let's check out the bum hat

957
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,920
it's not good for my rhetoric

958
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,900
where's my rhetoric

959
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,540
it's debating  nitpicking

960
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,760
it's already pretty short anyways

961
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,440
but my reaction speed

962
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,040
I mean I probably won't physically embarrass myself anymore

963
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,700
innocent situations can turn bad 

964
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:47,800
when you're overly alert

965
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,780
that's a good point

966
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,780
at low levels though  you won't be the one shooting first

967
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:55,140
you won't be shooting at all

968
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,980
I don't know should I wear the bum hat?

969
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,720
get some good reaction speed

970
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,940
it's kind of cool

971
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,240
it does go with

972
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,100
with the gloves and the trash bag

973
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:19,033
okay we're going to wear it for a little while

974
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,120
let's check out those barrels

975
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,620
it's full of rainwater

976
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,500
it's down here

977
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,500
just a closed door

978
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,300
I thought that this said like

979
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,620
enter the harbor

980
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:38,806
is this not the harbor or is this the pier

981
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,720
what is this

982
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,620
palette

983
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,720
ah there's money

984
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,860
cash money

985
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,160
and I got some magnesium

986
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,340
okay

987
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,000
some sea birds

988
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,680
bullet holes

989
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,540
let's check out that trash can

990
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,160
maybe I can turn in some of my trash now for some money

991
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,780
and I can buy that cigarette

992
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:16,553
and maybe we'll find the harbor along the way

993
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,740
turn in some of this trash

994
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,580
the tare machine stands in the corner

995
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,720
a sign says one bottle equals 10 cents

996
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,240
your bottles clunk into the machine

997
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:41,900
one forty

998
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,140
and the money appears with a satisfying jingle

999
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,300
you're a richer man now

1000
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,160
do you know what you should do with that money kiddo

1001
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,040
you should buy more alcohol

1002
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,018
enter the endless cycle of consumption

1003
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,380
I need ciggies

1004
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,133
you see several packaged raincoats fill a low shelf

1005
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,913
no  I don't need a raincoat

1006
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,789
that's what I need

1007
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:09,289
welcome to Frittte

1008
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:11,693
what's that magazine she's reading

1009
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:14,866
what it's I guess

1010
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:16,466
what's that magazine you're reading

1011
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,500
this is pop stars

1012
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,440
it's got like famous people in it

1013
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,200
emh rich I got two real

1014
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,820
looks like it also has something called police de la mode

1015
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,800
featured on page 34

1016
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,780
this speaks to you

1017
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:35,300
forget about all that

1018
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,240
what is this *fashion police* feature

1019
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,340
I'm not even interested

1020
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,800
I don't know why I asked about it

1021
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,220
let's ask about what's on the cover here

1022
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,000
it's where they rate different outfits famous people wear

1023
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,533
it's kind of funny

1024
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,720
they're kind of mean

1025
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,400
it's about who's the most stylish

1026
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,080
I bet your hat would take the prize

1027
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,980
um no I don't like it

1028
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,340
I hate it

1029
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,700
we are not the fashion police

1030
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,000
we're the real police

1031
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,740
as much as my cat is enjoying looking out the window

1032
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,866
it's blasting me with sunlight

1033
00:49:20,366 --> 00:49:21,320
what is this Frittte?

1034
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,200
I don't know Frittte

1035
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,620
a 7-to-11 grocery store

1036
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,500
I think they think that the extra it makes it *funkier*

1037
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:32,920
it doesn't

1038
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,400
let's proceed I have some quetions for you

1039
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,900
um okay

1040
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,520
I’m not really supposed to be chatting to anyone but

1041
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,340
can you tell me anything about the dead body

1042
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,640
maybe she's seen something

1043
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,120
I don't really know anything

1044
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,220
I mean I know it's there

1045
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,260
but I haven't seen it so

1046
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,180
kitty  no

1047
00:49:57,866 --> 00:49:59,235
there's a whole patio back there 

1048
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:00,900
that you can look out the window in

1049
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,066
why do you have to look out this one

1050
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,420
can't see shit

1051
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,880
I can't put a curtain up either because she'll tear it down

1052
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,920
did you know the man who died

1053
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,180
not really

1054
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,780
does it mean you knew him a little?

1055
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,880
no  I didn't know him at all

1056
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,180
I’m starting to think that the Frittte Clerk is the key to all of this

1057
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:22,980
how long has it been there

1058
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,933
I don't know really *long*

1059
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,440
here  I'm pointing my flashlight at something suspicious

1060
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,933
my suspicious thing here is why aren't you

1061
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,441
more interested in what's going on around you?

1062
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,700
why are you escaping into the celebrity gossip

1063
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,660
is it because you're so detached from the reality around you

1064
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:55,500
is it because no one at home reflects or asks about your interests

1065
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,152
is it because

1066
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:00,810
you don't have strong social relationships

1067
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,320
with any of your friends

1068
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,224
maybe you don't have friends because

1069
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,360
 you come from a home

1070
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,460
where you have to support most of the financial responsibilities

1071
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,120
and the only way to do so is to work this job that you hate

1072
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:16,533
and you have to talk to people like myself

1073
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,940
is that why you're reading from this stupid magazine

1074
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,940
and why are you giving me so much fucking lip

1075
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,400
is that it

1076
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,166
because that's the vibe I'm getting here

1077
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,911
she's like 14

1078
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:35,000
  hey she could be the primary breadwinner for all we know

1079
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,580
 right now  she's the main obstacle between me and a cigarette

1080
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:43,280
which is the main obstacle between me and this investigation

1081
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,620
so let's figure this out

1082
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,729
what do you think happened young lady

1083
00:51:48,729 --> 00:51:50,640
I don't know

1084
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,860
stop saying um

1085
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,706
it makes me sound like I'm an idiot just for asking

1086
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,040
no need to worry

1087
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,320
it's just standard procedure for us to ask around

1088
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:04,980
if you here anything let us know okay

1089
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,133
okay

1090
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,120
thank you for your help

1091
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,600
do you have a warehouse back there

1092
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,540
I don't know maybe I don't really care what Frittte does

1093
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,160
come on  give me something to work with here  please

1094
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,120
she looks up from under her brow

1095
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,080
fine Frittte doesn't have a warehouse

1096
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,700
just a little backroom here okay

1097
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,020
ok thank you you've finally given me something interesting

1098
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,600
I should stop pointing the flashlight at you now

1099
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,820
reality you mean what reality

1100
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,020
economic reality or

1101
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,200
yes tell me about the economic reality

1102
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,240
watch me be so fucking bang on with this character

1103
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,080
I don't really know anything I mean I'm 15

1104
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,200
15 is an *excellent* time to learn about the economic reality

1105
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:57,580
yeah  that's why I'm working my ass off in frick

1106
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,120
so I guess like that's economic

1107
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,040
why why is she doing that though

1108
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,800
I have to know I want to know if I'm right

1109
00:53:03,966 --> 00:53:06,186
I don't know what about it

1110
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,400
the Coalition what's that someone told me there is one

1111
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,380
our government?

1112
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,260
or do you mean something else

1113
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,260
sorry  I really need to finish this article

1114
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,860
ok she's getting a little anxious

1115
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,220
she's trying to avoid my questions

1116
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,820
we're in frittte

1117
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,591
no I meant--where *are* we 

1118
00:53:27,591 --> 00:53:28,306
on a larger scale

1119
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:30,860
as mankind or as a nation

1120
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,560
as mankind that's what I

1121
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,966
here's the thing okay

1122
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:36,474
if you don't have someone at home

1123
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:40,840
 asking you about your day or what you think about things 

1124
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,060
here is your opportunity young lady all right

1125
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:48,820
like an adult someone with a cool flashlight hat gloves and coat

1126
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,320
is asking you like your opinion about things

1127
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,300
the fact that she's so like um I don't know

1128
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,180
means that no one in her life is asking her things

1129
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,000
can you imagine

1130
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,586
she's going home and her mom or dad 

1131
00:54:04,056 --> 00:54:06,440
or whoever is taking care of her

1132
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,420
is not asking her

1133
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,300
so young lady  what do you think about the world

1134
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,881
why do you think we're making you 

1135
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:17,620
or asking you to work in this little shop

1136
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,520
would you like to know about the economic state that we're in

1137
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,796
like this girl has no real grounding

1138
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:24,520
for why she's doing any of these things

1139
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,200
because no one at home is engaging with her

1140
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,500
she probably goes home and her parents are just as burnt out

1141
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,640
by how fucked up their own lives are

1142
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,280
that like they're not asking her anything

1143
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,520
and so she's getting her stimulation

1144
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,726
and her like the only thing that's showing her 

1145
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:43,600
a reflection of her own interests is a fucking magazine 

1146
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,940
why because it depicts things that are not in her environment

1147
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,160
is this normal therapist behavior at a grocery store

1148
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,860
well yes

1149
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,620
internally internally

1150
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,480
I I'm not like

1151
00:55:09,177 --> 00:55:12,310
I do want you to just imagine me going into the store

1152
00:55:14,366 --> 00:55:15,166
and just like

1153
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,133
I don't know going on these sorts of rants

1154
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,940
it's a good image

1155
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,500
most insane disco elysium player

1156
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,176
what if she's relatively happy and fulfilled at home  

1157
00:55:30,176 --> 00:55:31,147
and just hates her job and is fed up with

1158
00:55:31,147 --> 00:55:32,880
kind of this kind of customer

1159
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:36,140
I mean I guess that could be the case too

1160
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,820
but I'm having a different kind of insight

1161
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:44,600
I mean  imagine imagine your person

1162
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,960
you're the person working in a place like this

1163
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
what is she selling

1164
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,933
she's selling alcohol cigarettes

1165
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,900
like an old boat or something

1166
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,942
like is any of this stuff was interesting to a teenager 

1167
00:55:58,942 --> 00:55:59,866
nope

1168
00:56:00,386 --> 00:56:02,530
she's not even like a cool teenager

1169
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,566
 working at like

1170
00:56:03,766 --> 00:56:05,500
spencer's or hot topic or something

1171
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,266
I don't know

1172
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,480
what teenagers are into these days

1173
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,580
I'm not one anymore

1174
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,149
but like she doesn't even work in a place 

1175
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:13,280
where she understands the

1176
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,540
the personal value of the things she's selling

1177
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,100
so of course  she's fed up with it

1178
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,960
she stands behind the counter and just like pedals the shit out

1179
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,660
mostly things that are bad for you

1180
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,640
and attracts the kinds of people who are

1181
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,400
like chemically dependent on these things

1182
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,680
and so she's going to get a lot of people like me and alcoholics

1183
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,500
and people with short tempers

1184
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,380
 because they haven't smoked recently

1185
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,040
like no wonder she hates her job

1186
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,920
out of all the characters you do a deep dive on  you choose this girl

1187
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,940
yeah  exactly

1188
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,040
ok  who else but this young girl

1189
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,724
it's the same thing I said about Kuno like

1190
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,880
what's most fascinating to me

1191
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,380
when I'm trying to understand world building

1192
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,980
and like if we're talking economic systems and political systems

1193
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:11,400
and the the like resentments that the veteran has

1194
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,700
you have to look at the kids who live in this world

1195
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
like they are the result of these problems

1196
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,260
like the way that they view the world

1197
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,694
the way they act in it 

1198
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:24,060
creates the culture around us

1199
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,000
of course  they don't want to engage with it right

1200
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,700
and it's all the more reason that if like

1201
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,366
the gentleman we saw down at the waterfront 

1202
00:57:34,252 --> 00:57:37,120
came in here and talked to the frittte clerk

1203
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,520
like he's the person that he's thinking of

1204
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,920
when he's yelling at us about how like you don't understand this stuff

1205
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,440
seache you know me so well

1206
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,950
watch I get to the plot relevant characters

1207
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,260
and I completely breeze over them

1208
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,640
you know that that's exactly what's going to happen

1209
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,980
like something really important is going to happen

1210
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,960
and I'm just going to be like  all right  whatever

1211
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,700
let's talking through it for 10 minutes holding a flashlight

1212
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,520
god damn

1213
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,220
she's this is the most unhinged part of our playthrough so far

1214
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,820
yeah  like she she's the character I’m most interested in

1215
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,320
I want to get involved in her life

1216
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,160
tell me what you think about mankind  sweetie

1217
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,420
in a good place

1218
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
look at her thinking

1219
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
she's never been asked a question like this

1220
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,502
I want your opinions on the world

1221
00:58:47,502 --> 00:58:49,620
I mean  science is doing great

1222
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,880
and this radio computer thing seems to be kind of big

1223
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,840
I don't know

1224
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,666
I don't know

1225
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,100
so she's exposed to like 

1226
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,780
things that are of a modern nature

1227
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,974
the fact that she brought up scientific things

1228
00:59:07,974 --> 00:59:09,140
does show that she has

1229
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,180
some capacity to grapple with technological things

1230
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,466
maybe she would rather be working in a lab right now

1231
00:59:15,466 --> 00:59:18,800
 than standing at this checkout counter selling cigarettes 

1232
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,860
let's ask her about the revolution

1233
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,694
when ordinary people take over the government and 

1234
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,240
um demands democracy

1235
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
look she is intelligent

1236
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,240
she knows things

1237
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,920
what about the one we had here in Revachol

1238
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,680
yeah  it happened like 50 years ago or so

1239
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,900
sorry  I'm not very good at this

1240
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,500
don't tell yourself that

1241
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,900
don't ever tell yourself that

1242
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,266
you know more than I do

1243
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,467
and you have probably had a conversation with

1244
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,167
the gentleman at the dock 

1245
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:54,060
and he told you you don't know anything about history 

1246
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,275
well  that's because

1247
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,333
he just wants you to learn his history not THE history

1248
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,740
what time is it

1249
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,480
I don't know

1250
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,360
look at the clock

1251
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,460
it's right behind you on the wall

1252
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,840
the clock shows the time at 10:09

1253
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,060
the hands seem to be still

1254
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,700
it's apparent the clock doesn't work

1255
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,960
ok I'm not going to bother you with this anymore

1256
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,840
but you have you have given me a lot to think about  young lady

1257
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,922
and I hope the world finds you in the...

1258
01:00:26,353 --> 01:00:29,000
with more opportunities as your life progresses

1259
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:29,800
cool

1260
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:32,620
cool

1261
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,200
she is cool I like her

1262
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:40,780
I want to be her friend and give her more opportunities

1263
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,560
now  let's see if she'll sell me a cigarette

1264
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,140
if she's the kind of

1265
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,875
a colorful diplay of cigarettes and 

1266
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,866
alcohol bottles lined the shop wall

1267
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:49,666
inviting you closer

1268
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,770
ok Frittte girl is going to win like maximum points

1269
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:56,060
if she gives me a cigarette as well like

1270
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,900
like most important character in the game right now 

1271
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,840
 she holds the key

1272
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:06,020
there in that dark green glass all in vain

1273
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,766
the great flowing river of warmth

1274
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:14,312
 wine alcohol beer alcohol love alcohol 

1275
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,060
this is not a good place for a recovering addict

1276
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,300
we know that but he's not self-aware enough

1277
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,100
let's just take it in

1278
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,648
I'm obliged to inform you that both

1279
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:25,631
alcohol and cigarettes damage your health

1280
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,980
but I guess you already know that

1281
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,380
ok that's true she does

1282
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,000
look at her being so concerned with my well-being

1283
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,520
she's got a good empathetic spine here

1284
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:42,060
don't ask don't look don't do anything here

1285
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,966
just go away

1286
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:44,960
get back to work

1287
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:45,780
ignoring that

1288
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,900
know this--you will never finish your alcohol quest

1289
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,975
if you don't buy beautiful alcohol

1290
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm so close I need 80 coins

1291
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:03,666
it gives me intellect

1292
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,933
that's what I'm missing

1293
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:11,533
I have been missing intellect this whole time

1294
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,666
fuck volition it doesn't want me to finish my quests

1295
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:22,166
um he pale age vodka is special  I guess

1296
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,255
it's stored in pale for a couple of years  which makes it

1297
01:02:25,255 --> 01:02:27,080
super expensive and super strong

1298
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,045
ok well consuming the stuff due to my body

1299
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:33,780
I mean I already said it'd hurt you

1300
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,366
I don't know what else they do

1301
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,420
substances give powerful bonuses to your main stats

1302
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,380
at the cost of damage to your health or morale

1303
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,900
cigarettes raise your intellect while damaging your health

1304
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,680
alcohol raises physique while damaging your morale

1305
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,600
well all I need to do is pack myself up with magnesium

1306
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,680
and I should like even out the alcoholism

1307
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,620
so I'm going to do that

1308
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:59,660
use medication like noseaphed and magnesium

1309
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,240
to counteract the negative effects of substances

1310
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,452
note  consuming substances can 

1311
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:07,900
have unforeseen consequences for you

1312
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:09,399
I don't know

1313
01:03:09,438 --> 01:03:12,038
it sounds like magnesium is a pretty swift

1314
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:18,000
cure for the alcohol and that will increase my physique

1315
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,720
so I'm going to be back

1316
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,520
I will be back  frittte girl I need some more bottles

1317
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,480
bottles first  then I will get the cigarettes

1318
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,533
and then I will be smart enough to continue the quest okay

1319
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,240
Kim can wait

1320
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,300
what is this money

1321
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,600
there's money on the ground

1322
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,640
I'm so close now

1323
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,880
there's got to be more bottles around here

1324
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,460
what is tommy up to

1325
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,040
tommy have any bottles

1326
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,740
oh  there's got to be bottles in here

1327
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,240
this is a bar after all

1328
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,020
I fucking I I'm telling you guys

1329
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,019
this case is going to blow wide open

1330
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:02,140
the second I get those cigarettes in my hands

1331
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,480
any bottles no bottles

1332
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:10,586
bunch of bottles in my room can I pick those ones up

1333
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,160
are they non-interactable

1334
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,733
this is what I feared 

1335
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:20,752
they're the non-interactable type of bottles

1336
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:21,980
ok

1337
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:27,480
that was a fruitless little venture

1338
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:39,920
the headline of this stream is 

1339
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,411
substance abuse counselor

1340
01:04:42,854 --> 01:04:47,860
desperately tries to find narcotics

1341
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,740
I'm not interacting with anything unless it is a piece of trash

1342
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,166
is that a piece of trash

1343
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,120
physical instrument  a tank top

1344
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:04,580
and it comes with no downsides

1345
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,160
fucking let's go

1346
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,680
oh  but

1347
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,380
conceptualization

1348
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,700
I think I can I'm going to swap this on

1349
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,655
physical instrumentI could use that

1350
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:29,440
no no no I don't care about any of that shit

1351
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:32,000
I just need bottles

1352
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,600
bottles

1353
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:43,053
money  there's fucking money just laying on the ground

1354
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:47,333
yes

1355
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,566
yes

1356
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,800
it's time

1357
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,446
it's time guys

1358
01:06:01,366 --> 01:06:01,986
okay

1359
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,264
a colorful display of cigarettes and 

1360
01:06:05,264 --> 01:06:07,460
alcohol bottles lined the shop wall

1361
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,360
inviting you closer

1362
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,917
again I'm obliged to inform you that

1363
01:06:11,917 --> 01:06:14,380
 both alcohol and cigarettes damage your health 

1364
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,360
yeah  frittte clerk

1365
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,720
well you didn't get the secret knowledge that I have

1366
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,620
which is that they come with lasting benefits as well

1367
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,700
here you go Mister

1368
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,240
I've got them

1369
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,720
I have got them!

1370
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,700
fucking finally it has only taken me nearly a dozen hours

1371
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,660
to get to the point

1372
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,500
fuck you you wouldn't give me a cigarette

1373
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,860
even tommy  the man

1374
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,260
the homie wouldn't give me a cigarette

1375
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,000
in fact I'm going to smoke my first one right in front of him

1376
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,200
look he's still smoking it

1377
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,320
ok it's been hours since we last talked

1378
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,340
meaning that wasn't really your last cigarette

1379
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,400
was it  tommy?

1380
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,920
I'll fucking show you

1381
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,540
before I only got four cigarettes

1382
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,520
how long do they last

1383
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,060
let's go with it smoke it up

1384
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,720
oh wait  I have to put away

1385
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,020
how do I use it?

1386
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:21,700
there it is

1387
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,300
a brave little army in your pocket

1388
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,560

1389

twenty brave souls standing in salute

1393
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,620
this soldier is fat and succulent

1394
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,360

1395
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,640

1396
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,400

01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,940

01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,980
go to pleasure land

1401
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,960
become a *genius*

1402
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,140
that's my tie

1403
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,700
the necktie

1404
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:07,840
it talks

1405
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,300
necktie chan

1406
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,500
wait a second

1407
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,605
so you're telling me that lighting up a cigarette was

1408
01:08:16,605 --> 01:08:18,880
finally the thing that woke my best buddy up

1409
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,740
well  fucking light it up then

1410
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,900
it's a load of this rock and roll cop here people

1411
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:32,600
johnny thunder cop fishes a cheap lighter out of his pants

1412
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,420
with a flick of the thumb this fire

1413
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,700
a primal satisfaction

1414
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,760
here we go

1415
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,820
drip that bad boy in flame and breathe it in

1416
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,820
thick warm smoke gets sucked down into your lungs

1417
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,100
intellect raised

1418
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:53,760
you feel a warm nostalgia fill your head body and soul

1419
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,620
a nostalgia for yourself the man you were in your youth 

1420
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,040
johnny thunder cop is back

1421
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,860
and he's chill as balls

1422
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,460
johnny thunder cop okay

1423
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,612
in the bottom right corner of the screen 

1424
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,020
there's a cigarettes button

1425
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,120
cigarettes gives plus one to intellect skills

1426
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,204
logic rhetoric conceptualization   

1427
01:09:18,204 --> 01:09:22,120
visual calculus encyclopedia and drama 

1428
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,388
this is good before a white check

1429
01:09:24,388 --> 01:09:25,720
but damages your health

1430
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,080
okay

1431
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,160
so I think I should clarify

1432
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:35,743
I am very anti-smoking 

1433
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,840
 especially in my professional work

1434
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,220
I don't smoke

1435
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:45,520
and in fact I very adamantly discourage it from people

1436
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:48,014
especially those who are

1437
01:09:48,014 --> 01:09:50,180
trying to recover from another substance

1438
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:55,160
because not only is there a lot of comorbidity

1439
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,759
between like

1440
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,760
using substances and that sort of thing

1441
01:10:02,733 --> 01:10:06,220
but what I perceive is that

1442
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,300
if you're trying to quit using one substance

1443
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:15,029
we're not just talking about the physical like 

1444
01:10:15,029 --> 01:10:18,620
implications of that like trying to

1445
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,646
trying to get your body re-stabilized

1446
01:10:22,646 --> 01:10:24,360
from not being dependent on that substance

1447
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,000
but it's also a behavioral thinglike

1448
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,800
you're trying to learn not to chase impulses

1449
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,765
you're trying to learn how to 

1450
01:10:30,765 --> 01:10:33,560
re-establish your body's sense of patience

1451
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:39,040
about how to not reward yourself with stimulation

1452
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:43,560
or curb your appetite by using tobacco or all of these things

1453
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,980
there's all kinds of behavioral and psychological implications

1454
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:51,140
to continuing to smoke while you're using or stopping use

1455
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,100
then again there's also people who say that

1456
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,660
harm reduction is the way to go

1457
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,900
and that one thing at a time

1458
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,760
don't try to quit this drug while also quitting cigarettes

1459
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:02,720
it'll make it harderbut

1460
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,680
but I'm of the perspective that

1461
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,884
continuing to have a vice for smoking 

1462
01:11:07,884 --> 01:11:11,116
actually makes it harder to quit the other thing

1463
01:11:11,116 --> 01:11:15,300
 because you're not working on the impulsive behaviors 

1464
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,140
at the same time

1465
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:22,180
just for clarity

1466
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:28,460
my excitement for this is that if I pure role playing perspective

1467
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,440
professionally speaking

1468
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,800
you can ask my coworkers

1469
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,380
I'm the most anti-smoking person that you'd find

1470
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,460
maybe this is my escapism

1471
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,140
I think smoking is garbage

1472
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,120
a therapist's playthrough wouldn't be as good

1473
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,920
if you didn't turn the MC into a train wreck

1474
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,240
anyhow getting him clean sober and sane would be boring

1475
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:56,940
well that's true

1476
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,412
look I'm going off of what I expect my character

1477
01:11:59,412 --> 01:12:02,514
to actually be stuggleing with 

1478
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,800
there is something to be said for

1479
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,060
we're trying to reclaim our past memories

1480
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:17,650
some memories live in physical sensation right

1481
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:18,680
smell especially

1482
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,080
if smoking a cigarette is going to help him

1483
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,920
figure out more about himself

1484
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,280
then that's probably something he would do

1485
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,520
but yes don't pick up smoking  

1486
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,500
it's terrible for you

1487
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,360
thank you for watching my video

1489

1493
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000

bye
