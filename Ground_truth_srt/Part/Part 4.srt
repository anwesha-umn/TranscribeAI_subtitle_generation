1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:00,966
okay

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:02,366
hello

3
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:04,700
and welcome back to our uh

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,100
therapist plays Disco Elysium let's play series

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,033
if you are new here then hello welcome

6
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,800
my name is Brady I'm a therapist

7
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:15,100
and we are doing like kind of a long form

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,500
psychoanalysis of the main character

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,966
and his companions and all the people

10
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,566
that we meet on our journey through Revachol

11
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,666
so in today's episode

12
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,366
we're going to talk a lot about

13
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:30,666
like our main characters reflections on his own self identity

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,266
as we sort of start to unpack and discover

15
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,666
things that he is remembering about his past and

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,066
psychologically what does it mean to

17
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,966
integrate a past version of yourself who you may not

18
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:45,733
have a lot of positive feelings about

19
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,566
into the identity that you're building today

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,166
and also we're gonna see if we could take

21
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,500
another shot this whole thing with Cuno

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,066
so

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
let's dive in

24
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,166
now one thing that is a kind of a hanging thread is

25
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,866
I want to return to my bedroom while I'm here

26
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,133
we're playing the game like reading some 

27
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,700
psychological class material

28
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,766
yeah if you're new to the eurobrady experience

29
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,763
this is one part entertainment 

30
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:14,800
 one part Masters level psychology lecture 

31
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,533
one part my own

32
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,266
self therapy life

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,400
for your enjoyment

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,100
read the problem part let's do that

35
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,600
let's rewind let's trace your drunken steps back home

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,766
jump across the raised channel bridge southwest of here

37
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,366
fall over get up

38
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,666
get off the asphalt in 20 minutes

39
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,533
shuffle your feet through courtyards

40
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,966
scaring little children

41
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:40,966
that checks out

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,166
go under the great raised motor tract the 8/81

43
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,600
until you reach Le Domaine Aminol in north Jamrock

44
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,466
the streets are frozen this time of year caked with ice

45
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,300
walk down Main to Perdition

46
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,366
there's a side alley there

47
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,133
and your footprints in the mud

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
okay

49
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,866
there's something there

50
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,333
there is a past for me

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
okay

52
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,700
this

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,533
Kim also tries not to look at the pile of tape viscera on the carpet

54
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,166
or the weird suitcase on the hat rack

55
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,066
or the pottic plant dying in the corner

56
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,866
but it's all just too morbid to ignore

57
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:36,733
oh that's true

58
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:39,133
this is the first time I've brought Kim into the environment

59
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:44,000
maybe in a subconscious way I'm trying to understand again

60
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:51,166
how much can I destroy my own image to him

61
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,666
before I come to the conclusion that he's not going to abandon me

62
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,966
maybe if I show him

63
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,533
something intimate and disgusting about myself

64
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,466
maybe he will finally abandon me

65
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:06,766
he nods

66
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,000
nod stoically that sounds

67
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,366
he takes a step toward the door

68
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,300
like he'd like to leave

69
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,933
oh he's ashamed to be with me

70
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,366
I'm not finding a lot of security in him

71
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,533
I'm gonna be honest guys

72
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,533
I know Kim is a hype character

73
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,166
people have been really upset about how like

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,266
I'm not like taken to him so quickly but

75
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,800
psychologically speaking like everything that he does

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,833
is showing me that he does not like trust me

77
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,733
and that the only reason he's sticking with me

78
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,800
is because he needs something for me

79
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:50,133
the bed is cold and not particularly inviting

80
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,566
but it's yours

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,233
the sheets(look awful)

82
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,566
the option to go to sleep becomes available

83
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,566
every night after 9 PM

84
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:57,666
okay

85
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,366
okay let's see if I can get my tie down and

86
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,333
wait

87
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,266
was there

88
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,000
there's something I could do to like

89
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,066
try this again right

90
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,166
yeah the ceiling fan

91
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:22,866
sevoir fair that's what I need

92
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,966
I'm still not very good at this

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,800
this fan has two chain pull switches

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,566
one ends in a tiny fan the other in a light bulb

95
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:43,133
a truly horrific neck tire somehow attached itself to one of the blades

96
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,966
or has it been consigned there as punishment

97
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:47,766
okay we saw this(before)

98
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,500
you feel as though this creature is your friend

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,133
and wants to reattach itself to your neck

100
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:58,566
so that you may continue your adventures together in this strange world

101
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,933
okay last time we tried to just get the tie and it did not work

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,900
let's try

103
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,000
turning the fan off

104
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,866
(The blades)come squeaking into a holt

105
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,500
it should be easier to reach the tie now

106
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,866
okay 72 percent

107
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,700
there's no way I can fail this right

108
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,733
you swoop up and catch the tie snap

109
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,533
it's released from the blade

110
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,133
the luck continues

111
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,400
warning warning

112
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,966
the necktie is no longer contained

113
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,166
what you have in your hand is a fantastically colorful tie

114
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,200
with four or five different patterns

115
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,933
(The)knot reminds you of a noose

116
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,366
okay we've got a tie

117
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,166
it is

118
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:41,800
it's there it's on

119
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,100
let's go scope on that

120
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,600
that tie there

121
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,366
no I want to keep I want to keep the crowbar

122
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,166
where's the tie

123
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,266
oh there it is

124
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:59,200
the necktie is adorned with a garnish a garish pattern

125
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
it's disturbingly vivid

126
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,733
somehow you feel as if it will be wrong to ever take it off

127
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,653
it's your friend now 

128
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:08,700
you will betray it if you change it for some boring scarf 

129
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:10,533
okay

130
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:19,200
and I guess I guess I could look in the mirror

131
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:21,766
I'll tell you what

132
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,300
narratively speaking

133
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,600
if I'm just going by role play

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,166
after my interaction with Lana

135
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,366
the sweet grandma in the wheelchair

136
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm suddenly feeling like I can humanize myself a little bit more

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,600
than I could at the beginning of this playthrough

138
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,766
and I finally feel secure enough to look at my own countenance

139
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:43,766
lets do that now

140
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,266
a mirror hangs on the wall covered in steam

141
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,600
you cannot see yourself

142
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,400
just the outlines of a man

143
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,933
you have no memory of the face that awaits you there

144
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,400
underneath the soft vapor

145
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,266
well and we are trying to figure out now who we are

146
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:11,066
as you slowly reach your hand towards the surface of the mirror

147
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,100
abort you clearly have not thought this through

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,066
you won't like what you see there

149
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,166
and you will never unbecome it

150
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,000
okay Inland Empire again

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,733
another competing mental state that is coming in to tell me

152
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,366
there is a concern that I am not ready for this

153
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,133
right now what my character is wanting

154
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:39,066
is a way to connect his past self

155
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:44,000
but this would invite me to reflect on my present self

156
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,633
who I have not decided if I like very much yet

157
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,500
this is a big risky move

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,166
maybe I should touch it first

159
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,966
make sure there's nothing wrong with my face

160
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:58,200
yeah there is definitely something wrong with it

161
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
maybe it's okay to continue living in denial for now

162
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,366
where to even begin

163
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
there is the bloatedness

164
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,533
then the swollenness

165
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:13,333
it's like there's an upholstery of alcohol underneath your skin

166
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,733
I'm scared I want to stop doing this

167
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,966
I'm sorry at least my tongue is okay

168
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,566
there's a lot of anxiety

169
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,400
bet you are

170
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,300
your nose feels like a small balloon in the middle of your face

171
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,733
it hurts when you honk it

172
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,733
it doesn't appear to be a particularly tiny nose either

173
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,533
not with all the drinks it's absorbed for you

174
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,466
at least my tongue is okay

175
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,400
it's not

176
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,933
(It's)swollen and snail like wriggling between your fingers

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,500
don't be scared

178
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,100
it's only your face

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,766
it's not like anyone's going to see it

180
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,300
okay everything about this is telling me that

181
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,600
I do not feel comfortable doing this yet

182
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,133
from a character perspective I'm not doing it

183
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,500
there's something this like

184
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,666
there's something that tells me not to right now

185
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,133
my character is not ready yet

186
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,500
he's

187
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,233
I already came back for the tie all right

188
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:15,800
that's a big step for me to start retracing my steps

189
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,100
and like showing interest

190
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,866
some discomfort is good absolutely

191
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
but

192
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,066
I feel like that would be too much of a confrontation to myself

193
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,900
yeah I gotta go through a character arc first

194
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,166
I hope you guys understand like

195
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,200
I intend to role play this the entire way through

196
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,300
someone is working let's check this out

197
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,733
we got in the sink

198
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,200
tomato

199
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,500
that's not good

200
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:56,266
a thin man is smoking below an exhaust hood

201
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,533
occasionally sipping from his mug

202
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,366
this must be the Whirlings cook

203
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,333
he's got a cigarette

204
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,700
okay

205
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,233
this is my moment all right

206
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:11,866
I have failed at every opportunity to stimulate myself

207
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,900
maybe if I had a cig I'd be okay looking at myself in the mirror

208
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,300
maybe this is the time

209
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,966
all right all right

210
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:19,966
I gotta prepare myself

211
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:21,900
this is this I cannot fail this one

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,066
as you step in

213
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,933
he nods toward the table

214
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:31,200
and says something in a completely foreign language

215
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,533
the only words you can make out are 'goracy' and 'kubek'

216
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,266
okay there is a language barrier

217
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:41,033
but there is a universal understanding

218
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:46,800
of the sweet nicotine release

219
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,200
that that a man who is too tired for his own life

220
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,333
would get from a sweet drug

221
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,166
it must be his name Goracy

222
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,766
Goracy Kubek

223
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,966
sounds representative

224
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,133
my logic side is so stupid

225
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,800
okay do I want to establish a power dynamic right

226
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
my character is very much like

227
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,366
authority oriented everything is about a power dynamic

228
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:18,166
so

229
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:21,566
I already feel inferior by not understanding his language

230
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:24,300
that reminds me of how insecure I am

231
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,766
about where I have ended up in the world

232
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,366
and why I don't remember things

233
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:32,000
so it makes sense for me to want to establish power over him

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,866
by saying you know I have an authority role

235
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:38,766
the man puts his cup down and replies something

236
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,100
his left hand drawing arcs in the air

237
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:46,800
you've got some impressive pots there

238
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,666
he smiles and bangs his ladle against each of his pots in turn

239
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,200
what

240
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,733
no I I do need something

241
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,200
no I

242
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,933
the man ponders his cooking utensils and

243
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:00,966
fuck

244
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,500
acknowledging your presence

245
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,966
I can't

246
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,300
he smiles and

247
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,733
I can't ask him for a cig

248
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,533
God damn it he doesn't understand me

249
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,533
steel door with

250
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,000
you immediately feel drawn to the color

251
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,333
blue is for mystery

252
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,566
oh I wonder where this door leads

253
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:22,366
you do

254
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,000
it's a door in the back of the kitchen

255
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,066
why do you care where it leads

256
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,266
I'm drawn to its cobalt blue Kim

257
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:31,500
you would know that if you

258
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,300
had any interest in understanding me

259
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,600
it is quite pretty

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,933
I suppose we could look into it as a side investigation

261
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,266
yes a mini side-investigation

262
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:45,066
I'm trying to see how much you're willing to put up

263
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:48,466
(Garte)the person to ask this the cafeteria manager

264
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,266
I want to touch the door

265
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:53,300
the cobalt blue surface feels rough to touch

266
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,966
the stainless steel door is flush with its frame on every side

267
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:58,966
I want to push the door

268
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,933
door does not budge

269
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:03,333
I have to leave the door for now

270
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,100
let's see what Garte has to say about it

271
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,900
can I help you

272
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
another thing great

273
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,933
I oh yes that door sure

274
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,400
there's nothing mysterious about it

275
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,500
it's just a door

276
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,066
do you know what's behind it

277
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,700
no I don't have a key

278
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,566
I don't know how to get there

279
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,300
and I don't care either

280
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,466
it's not like I've been wondering about it for 10 years

281
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,100
it's just a Frittte warehouse probably

282
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,000
or some boring storage space with a bunch of old junk and dust

283
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,966
junk and dust

284
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:44,733
he's attempting to maintain an air of indifference

285
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,400
it's absolutely not convincing

286
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,600
I think he I I

287
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,166
let him get to pretend it's indifferent okay

288
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,600
power dynamics it's all about staying composed

289
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
he looks at the dust on his finger and wipes it off

290
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,733
okay we'll leave it for now

291
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,966
I do not trust him

292
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,266
all right let's blow this joint wait who's this gentleman

293
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,400
that sugary black rum stain on the counter

294
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
makes you teary eyed with joy

295
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,566
it's almost touched in how syrupy and sticky it is

296
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,066
how long have you been up already

297
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,733
it's drink o'clock

298
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:31,900
my character is probably

299
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,933
probably hounding for something here

300
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:36,500
atta boy it's coming back to him

301
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,133
you had your mesolympic reward pathway worried there

302
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,866
not thinking about drinking all that time

303
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,966
it was like you weren't yourself

304
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
yep

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,866
there's a competing mental state here

306
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,233
this one is so powerful

307
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:56,100
that it's able to wrench me from my construction of identity

308
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,500
actually I should be thinking about this

309
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:05,066
drinking hasn't turned out too well from me

310
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:06,166
I want to say this

311
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,266
but I don't know if my character has that insight yet

312
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:11,133
I do need a rum in lemonade

313
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,266
I love fregart to serve me up a beverage

314
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,100
he did say the drinks were on him let's see what

315
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,000
or don't forget about it

316
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,966
you should totally try to get a drink there too

317
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:23,566
but first

318
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:24,366
I can do both

319
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,566
lick that stain off the counter

320
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,933
yeah man let's get wild lick it

321
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,466
let's go halfway there

322
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,400
calmly the lieutenant looks out of the window

323
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:44,500
then to you

324
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,933
licking the tasty rum state off the counter but only a little

325
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,366
then out of the window again

326
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:52,900
what are you doing

327
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,766
investigating

328
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:58,800
we should move

329
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,866
a real drink would go well

330
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:02,466
with those cigarettes you're looking for

331
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,600
that's a great combination

332
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,100
it knows it knows what I'm looking for

333
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,900
it's all about money you know who benefits

334
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,700
okay let's uh let's get out of here

335
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't think I can get a drink right now

336
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,900
don't give in

337
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,566
okay what were we doing

338
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:34,333
I spent a long time in there

339
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:38,866
sort of reflecting on my entire world view and sense of self

340
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,100
and whether or not I feel comfortable with this person

341
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,800
I've been traveling with and

342
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,700
what are his motivations for being with me

343
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:52,966
we've gotten very introspective in the whirling in rags

344
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,266
there's a nostalgic sense I'll always feel towards this place

345
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,666
now having gone through that mental adventure in there

346
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,500
it only took us like 10 hours to get to that point

347
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,866
yeah welcome to welcome to the year of Brady experience

348
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,066
oh my God so many things to do

349
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,600
I'm never gonna complete this game

350
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,866
open the trash container let's start with this

351
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,766
there's a lock trash container behind the whirling in(rags)

352
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,333
I need clear directions

353
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,533
let's go check out the trash okay

354
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,700
I'm a little scared to see Cuno again

355
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,766
but I'm hoping that like

356
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,333
now that I have this pretty cool tie on

357
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,966
maybe he either won't recognize me or he'll think I'm cool

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,333
let's check out the trash can

359
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,733
let's go scope on that

360
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,200
this trash container is locked

361
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,800
the sliding lid has a padlock that says whirling-in-rags

362
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:56,066
with a well oiled crack the lock pops open

363
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,533
it should now be possible to simply raise the lid

364
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,833
and see this is a point

365
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:06,666
where I in the process of therapy with my character

366
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,933
would find it very important to highlight what he just did right

367
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,162
through elements of deduction 

368
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:15,100
through elements of empathy

369
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,233
through basically an apology to the person that

370
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,733
he slipped out on before

371
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
he managed to get a key

372
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,333
and this has pushed forward his investigation

373
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:27,166
this should absolutely reinforce his self esteem

374
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:27,833
excuse me

375
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,900
his  self esteem

376
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,566
but I would find it very common

377
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,666
for the character to not see it that way

378
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
the narrative that he's going to be telling himself is rather that

379
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,366
every achievement I have is based on luck

380
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,566
but every bad thing that happens to me is a character defect

381
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:47,600
that's a very common framework for someone who

382
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,066
is either depressed or critically lacking self esteem right

383
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
and so I would want to make a very special notice of

384
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,200
like this is a win

385
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,633
this is an achievement that you've gotten to

386
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,566
based on your skill set and

387
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:05,266
your ability to read and understand people right

388
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,600
it's not for me to interpret that for him

389
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,866
I would have to engage him with questions

390
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:16,866
like what was it like for you to finally open the trash can

391
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,300
well I you know I I was 

392
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,700
I was pissed off because I couldn't open it before

393
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,933
okay so he's getting in touch with the anger

394
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:28,500
instead of the sense of gratitude towards himself

395
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,600
we're not quite there

396
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,333
right I might need to ask a different way of this

397
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,400
so when you got the key from Garte right

398
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:39,500
what did that tell you about him as a person

399
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,366
right I'm trying to get him closer to

400
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,333
more of an apathetic response right

401
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,700
those are the kinds of questions that I might start

402
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,800
engaging with him

403
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,233
because it's not my role as a therapist

404
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:56,266
to interpret positive narratives for people

405
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,333
that's like not the goal

406
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,000
the goal is to help you develop a not always positive

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but realistic framework about yourself right

408
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,466
I would much rather you feel

409
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,866
like conflicted but realistic

410
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,233
about what's happening around you

411
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,933
than wholly positive

412
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,966
because then we're just being delusional

413
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,166
telling ourselves that everything is great and

414
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,666
we're a fucking great cop and great person

415
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,166
like that's not what that's not real either right

416
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,466
I don't want I don't want to replace reality with just positivity

417
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,733
I want to find a healthy middle ground

418
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,133
don't maybe you shouldn't

419
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,666
didn't I just have a premonition that

420
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,166
there's something in there

421
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:45,575
there is but you won't like it 

422
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,300
sweat forms on your brow

423
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,666
your hand is still on the lid

424
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:55,766
I'm gonna open it

425
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,900
the smell of rotten food rises to greet you

426
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,475
you see soggy cartons dirty rags 

427
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,133
and organic waste

428
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,133
okay

429
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,700
we're just in time

430
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,333
this hasn't been emptied for over a week

431
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,366
let's check out the cartons first

432
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:18,400
milk and egg rest with one broken egg in it

433
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,866
some pasta wrapper

434
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,166
picking up the soggy packages somehow feels familiar

435
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,739
a box falls into pieces in your hands 

436
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,866
Batise Soleil cereal

437
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,533
there are plastic pasta packages below

438
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:33,533
and turbo noodles

439
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,266
nothing of note however

440
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,066
okay let's check out those rags

441
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,300
maybe there's something interesting there

442
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,500
among the threadbare kitchen towels

443
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
something catches your eye

444
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,000
a pair of denim trousers

445
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,513
get 'em

446
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,933
as the legs of the slime covered jeans begin to unspool from the garbage 

447
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,466
a rank corpse smell fills the air

448
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,133
the victim's clothes

449
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,266
cadaverine odour is faint

450
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,333
if this belonged to the deceased

451
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:02,566
they were removed when he was still in the early stages of decay 

452
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,366
drop them in here officer

453
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,900
let's bag those trousers

454
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,933
guitar mark blue jeans

455
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:12,333
pockets empty or emptied

456
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,655
he wore them with a belt too

457
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:15,733
a wide belt

458
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,516
the loops appear stretched but

459
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:19,766
 the belt is missing

460
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,827
that's it

461
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,533
 do you see anything else in there

462
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,333
I have another bag here

463
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,566
something slimy catches your eye

464
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:29,866
a drab long sleeved shirt olive coloured 

465
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,066
appears from the food waste dripping with pus

466
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
this is a military type over-garment

467
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,666
no label or serial number

468
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,138
this is the kind of rib-knit shirt that's worn over light armour

469
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,533
 to conceal it in an urban scenario

470
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,500
the rest of the rags are just kitchen variety waste

471
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,100
a yellow old mug that catches your eye

472
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,800
but other than that

473
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,500
all right we should go to Garte again

474
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,300
and ask if he knows who put your clothes in the trash

475
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,800
it could be as simple as someone from the hostel cleaning the yard 

476
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,300
or that one

477
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,933
I'd advise against confronting that force

478
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,500
another encounter with Cuno

479
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,600
we need to ask the kids who put them here

480
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:17,700
I'm not satisfied by the last time 

481
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,133
I encountered him

482
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,400
oh yeah thank god I have the garden gloves

483
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,123
I don't even think of that 

484
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:27,266
I'm stumbling my way through success again 

485
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,733
the fuck's he on about kids

486
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:33,133
you hear that Cuno

487
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,366
he thinks you're an infant or something

488
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,200
see

489
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:38,566
not really

490
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,933
all we know is the victim's clothes are in the trash

491
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:45,066
the lid was locked and this establishment had the key

492
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,500
it's just a small loose thread

493
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,466
the lieutenant nods

494
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:52,266
then looks back into the trash container

495
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:54,600
let's check out that food waste

496
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,600
it's just organic waste cold and slimy on your hands

497
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,166
apple and potato peels mostly

498
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:02,933
unidentified sludge

499
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:06,266
and the occasional chicken bow thrown in for good measure 

500
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,300
but hey 

501
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,268
nothing it's nothing  

502
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:11,633
nothing more to see here 

503
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:12,900
what's this

504
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:15,133
oh what is it

505
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:18,333
a blue piece of plastic sticks out from the apple peels

506
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:19,429
it's shiny 

507
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,400
looks like the corner of something

508
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,000
something larger

509
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:24,394
a clipboard

510
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:26,049
 a blue plastic clipboard

511
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,200
 with moist papers hanging from it 

512
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,600
they look badly damaged

513
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,266
but you can still make out forms and notes

514
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,600
written in a man's handwriting

515
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,966
okay that's clue

516
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
officer is that your paperwork

517
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:41,666
oh shit

518
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,229
it is look 

519
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:46,000
the plastic has the RCM street grid on it

520
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,533
you've even got an autopsy form in there

521
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:50,966
wait a second fucking

522
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,733
the Inland Empire is supposed to be my boy

523
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,366
it's supposed to have never steered me wrong

524
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,333
what is Inland Empire

525
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,966
why is it trying to keep me from my own identity

526
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
does it have a motive of keeping me

527
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,883
as a blank slate

528
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,700
 because in its cosmic desires 

529
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,100
it can imprint upon me any sort of personality it desires 

530
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,466
and that if I were to regain my own memories

531
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,457
it would have no place to influence my decisions  

532
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:24,700
because I would have characteristics of my own 

533
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,300
who benefits

534
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,100
if you don't mind my asking

535
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,066
how could you have let your paperwork end up in the trash 

536
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,300
why was I in the trash that's a question

537
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:45,066
think I didn't want to be a cop anymore maybe

538
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,133
well

539
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,766
his eyes express a rare condolence

540
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,900
then he picks it up

541
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,933
maybe Kim does not want to be a cop either

542
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,333
maybe this is the only way he knows how to

543
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,100
apply himself as well is by being a cop

544
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,966
if you put Kim in a different position

545
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,200
would he have the same level of conviction

546
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,066
or the authority to act on those convictions

547
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,166
probably not

548
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,933
does Kim work as a cop because he wants to help people 

549
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,400
or because it gives him a purpose

550
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,966
is it out of self interest

551
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,266
or is it out of

552
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,200
a desire to right the wrongs of the world

553
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,400
I guess we'll find out

554
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,533
lucky we found it

555
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,666
you should take stock of what remains

556
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,632
just to be sure some has not made it 

557
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,000
into the hands of the RCM's adversaries 

558
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,933
organized crime and the like

559
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,500
there might have been police secrets in your notes

560
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:49,266
okay I'll do that

561
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:52,666
it would also not hurt to start taking notes on the case 

562
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,975
now tell me what your eagle eyes see 

563
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,466
or are we finished

564
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:57,240
I got the eagle eyes

565
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,766
some items such as the ledger you found are interactable

566
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,666
go to your inventory

567
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:05,566
and select the Interact tab to read your paperwork

568
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:06,533
okay

569
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,484
you pick out a broken mug 

570
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:13,733
with an oddly racist depiction of the yellow man frolicking in saffron 

571
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,733
only in its social sensibility

572
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:22,400
the container sounds of muffled gong

573
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,533
okay well that was insightful

574
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:28,133
that's one thing of the least

575
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,700
I think we got it all

576
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:30,766
okay

577
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,900
so we've done we've accomplished one thing so far

578
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,366
let's check out that mug

579
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,666
it's just a racist mug

580
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,733
what's there to read here

581
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,300
not much

582
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,566
let's look at all that content I mean

583
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,500
oh boy

584
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,466
here we go

585
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,521
what are you going to say about

586
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:53,600
 a broken tossed away mug that you dug out of the garbage 

587
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:57,866
this mug is an example of prejudice

588
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,733
I'm going to use it as an example of what not to do

589
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,200
push this into the face of every merchant I find

590
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,000
and tell them this is your inane ideology 

591
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,198
by denouncing it I can earn political capital  

592
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:14,166
to mask my badass hustling

593
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,966
the mug didn't belong in the trash

594
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:17,466
it's just a funny mug

595
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,566
yes I think

596
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,766
I think I will use this as a

597
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,533
as a sign of gaining influence over others 

598
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:37,366
if you want to earn some change by guilting people

599
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:38,398
go for it 

600
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:40,700
but if you want to earn real dough

601
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,800
finish the case and start getting paid again 

602
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,100
fuck okay fine

603
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,066
let's check this out

604
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:48,200
it's the ledger you found in the trash

605
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,133
a pitiful cabbage of white and yellow papers hanging from plastic board 

606
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,733
barely held together by a metal clip

607
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,166
this sad display is made complete by the faint smell of urinal cleaner 

608
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,533
there is a piece of toilet paper

609
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,333
or is it cleaning tissue

610
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,500
no it's toilet paper

611
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:10,266
desperately stick into the back of the blue plastic clipboard 

612
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,850
it's a metaphor for you 

613
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:16,800
below the pathetics terror

614
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,500
do not look into its blue heart

615
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,100
okay the Inland Empire is starting to get suspicious to me

616
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,000
why doesn't it want me to figure out who I was

617
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,366
let's check out that toilet paper

618
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:27,900
it's just toilet paper

619
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,200
stick it to the back of the plastic clipboard

620
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:32,000
you can take it off if you want

621
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,300
maybe it's kitchen tissue

622
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,467
if you want it to be kitchen tissue

623
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,666
it can be kitchen tissue

624
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:40,416
it's not though it's toilet paper 

625
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,556
okay let's take it off

626
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:44,900
 leave it there it's cool

627
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,476
I'll take it

628
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:49,600
still wet the toilet paper I mean kitchen tissue sorry

629
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,700
peels off the plastic easily

630
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,200
leave it

631
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,933
all you have to do is shake it off your finger and

632
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,666
voila the legend now looks marginally better 

633
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,600
okay let's take a look at that clip

634
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,500
an aluminium block runs the width of the board

635
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,500
biting down on the paperwork

636
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:10,333
its crocodile teeth are the only thing keeping the papers together 

637
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,800
a regular pencil the tip worn down to nothing

638
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:15,933
has been attached to the clip

639
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:19,733
the surface is interrupted by a silvery sticker 

640
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:23,000
it's rectangular sparkling with iridescence

641
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,700
you don't know how you didn't notice it before

642
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:26,866
what's this

643
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:30,133
that thing it's a halogen watermark

644
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:33,200
we use it for adding information to RCM property

645
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,466
what kind of information

646
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,733
it depends aside from an anti-counterfeiting stamp

647
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:40,200
mine has my station number and address

648
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,866
the information varies by date of issue

649
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:47,037
how many years you've been on the force he's thinking  

650
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:48,266
it'll have that

651
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:49,734
how can I be

652
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:51,933
any capable light with the right wavelength will do

653
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:53,166
okay

654
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,053
all RCM vehicles have had lights designed to  

655
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:59,666
reveal illusion watermarks mine too

656
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,766
so maybe I could actually find out what my address is

657
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:05,800
if this has some of that information on it

658
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,400
this means you can read the watermarks

659
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,366
if you just turn the lights on

660
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,466
okay

661
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:15,866
while a bunch of sodden papers sag from the clipboard in your hand 

662
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,600
it's a sorry sight

663
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,574
let's look at the clipboard

664
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:21,400
 it's made of dark blue plastic

665
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,966
hard enough to beat someone to submission with

666
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,133
the edges are rounded however

667
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:30,000
the U4 size board feels thick and heavy in your hand

668
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,733
light shimmers on its wet surface

669
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:36,900
on the back you see the embossed letters RCM

670
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,305
hmm let's shake it

671
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:39,800
 something rattles inside

672
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,133
ever so lightly

673
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,966
peek inside

674
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,927
the plastic shimmers like lapis lazuli 

675
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,600
but it is not see through

676
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
you cannot see to its center

677
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:49,666
blue

678
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:53,933
something about the color blue is important

679
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
don't look into it

680
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,466
I'm gonna look into it

681
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,195
I'm not trusting Inland Empire anymore

682
00:31:58,195 --> 00:31:59,366
 with your hands

683
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:04,100
U4 sized pages hang from the clip screwed to the top of the board 

684
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,266
oh boy okay

685
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,366
I should try

686
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,133
I should probably do more dialogue first right

687
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:20,000
every time I see one of these I just want to go right into it 

688
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,596
they're not exactly white

689
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:25,400
they're yellowed in patches by sunlight and alcohol

690
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,900
and covered in dense blue handwriting

691
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,766
ink escapes into watercolor patterns

692
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:33,666
reaching its tendrils across entire pages

693
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,766
the paper itself is chequered

694
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,400
with faint red lines forming short paragraphs

695
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,676
once in a while there's a red stamp 

696
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:45,600
that exclaims case files commit to paper 

697
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,600
the case files themselves are plenty

698
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,855
you count more than 100 sodden crumpled up earmarked pages  

699
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:55,000
falling apart in your hands

700
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:57,333
they appear to be sufficiently organized

701
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,966
and extremely dense

702
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:00,533
if mostly illegible

703
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,423
let's check them out 

704
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:05,133
work strife poverty the Jamrock Quarter 

705
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,827
these are handwritten logs of investigations 

706
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:10,000
dating back to January 51 

707
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:10,993
this year 

708
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:15,693
the exact number is hard to estimate due to missing pages 

709
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,033
 and an odd nameing convention

710
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,700
but there are at least 20

711
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,325
maybe 30 cases

712
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,300
 undertaken not completed mind you

713
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,066
okay this is actually really interesting for like

714
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,166
again I'm imagining I'm the therapist of my character 

715
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:39,500
let's imagine the content of our session is

716
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,300
he brings in this clip board 

717
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,591
it's got all these things on it

718
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:47,666
it's got artifacts of who he was on it and 

719
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,500
we might be able to investigate

720
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,166
and say like

721
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,366
not what can we figure out from it because like

722
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,566
the goal of therapy is not to be

723
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,733
it's not always to

724
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,325
necessarily intellectually understand something 

725
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:11,666
it's to process reactions to things 

726
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:13,600
so the question I might have for him is like

727
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,133
what did you feel when you were looking at this right

728
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,866
and I could imagine him saying well it was confusing

729
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,800
right

730
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,900
what was it like to see

731
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,966
that the way you organized yourself was very

732
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,500
disruptive even before you lost your memory because

733
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,266
there are missing pages

734
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:33,366
there's odd naming conventions

735
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:36,733
there's all these undertaken quests that aren't complete 

736
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,600
just like the play through we're doing right now

737
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,500
like I would

738
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:46,393
I would be less invested in trying to get him to puzzle out what happened 

739
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:51,100
and more presently what is your reaction to seeing this right 

740
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:54,800
because to me it seems like the person he was is not

741
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,966
too dissimilar to who he is

742
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:59,866
meaning that losing his memory did not erase

743
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:03,533
his personality or his way of organizing the world

744
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:08,161
it's this is exactly like how our current character is 

745
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:09,400
like look at this shit

746
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,100
look at all these fucking things

747
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:13,812
look at all these like tasks we've undertaken 

748
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,100
and done nothing on them 

749
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,500
yes it appears you employer

750
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:26,933
shall we say robust yet literary system

751
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:30,900
each investigation has its case number written on the margins 

752
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:35,866
yet still more tellingly most accompanied by a name

753
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:38,933
and for a lot of that practice 

754
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:40,600
what I'm trying to do is get the character

755
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:43,666
or the client to empathize with themselves

756
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:48,800
I might ask him what do you think about the person who wrote this 

757
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:51,666
well he seems like a mess

758
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:54,066
what does it mean to be a mess

759
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,100
well it's someone I don't have a lot of respect for 

760
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,933
how can they live their life like that

761
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:04,000
it's also someone I can relate to right

762
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:06,933
what I'm looking for is a way to empathize with the self 

763
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:09,533
because the self relationship is the core of why

764
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:13,800
this character feels detached and 

765
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,800
it's all the reasons why every time Lena was praising him he like 

766
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:20,966
minimized that praise and was like yeah

767
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:22,400
oh I look like shit

768
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,933
no I'm not a real cop

769
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:27,133
this world isn't even structured around having cops

770
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,200
the political system isn't even equipped for it

771
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,566
like he found all these ways to minimize

772
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,266
the way she praised him

773
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:36,333
because he doesn't care enough about himself right

774
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,766
so that would be one of my goals as the therapist

775
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:39,566
is like

776
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,166
this would be a great opportunity to start working on that 

777
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,933
is how do we empathize with the person who wrote this

778
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:51,266
this stuff and like you know threw it away

779
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:55,375
yes all caps

780
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:58,466
 one is called THE NEXT WORLD MURAL

781
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,565
another THE SQUARE BULLET HOLE MUDERS

782
00:37:01,565 --> 00:37:04,925
another yet THE UNSOLVEABLE CASE

783
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:07,966
others appear more light hearted

784
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,133
THE GUYS ON A COUCH IN AN UNEXPECTED LOCATION

785
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,666
and TEH MURDER AT THE HOOKAH PARLOUR

786
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:16,766
even the rare article free COLLAPSING TENEMENT

787
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,533
murder features prominently throughout

788
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:23,750
it's time to take an effort to piece these case files together 

789
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,200
 but it can be done

790
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,466
once you're done inspecting them up close

791
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:31,500
Kim my cases appear to employ some kind of naming convention 

792
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,300
let's get Kim involved

793
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,700
you mean the alfanimeric

794
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:36,600
officer precinct time of arrival at the scene

795
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:40,700
a non numeric one with titles

796
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,966
oh you mean the titular

797
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,466
yes well so do I

798
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,850
in our defense almost everyone in the RCM does

799
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,584
it's a holdover from the early days of the RCM

800
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:52,166
right after the revolution

801
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,200
when the organization had little idea how to do things 

802
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,366
it persists in an unofficial capacity

803
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:02,000
officers use these titles to refer to their work among themselves 

804
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:05,966
I seem to have named a case the Square Bullet Hole Murderers 

805
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,450
again in your defense 

806
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,100
I seem to have named one

807
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:13,266
the man with the hole in his head

808
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:14,933
that was a real person

809
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,500
his death was real

810
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
still I named it that

811
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,533
to amuse myself

812
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,300
to amuse yourself

813
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,066
once again Kim's personality sneaking through

814
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,600
I pray his loved ones never find out

815
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:30,466
rails spike through the head

816
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,700
he died it was a workplace accident

817
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:36,000
I have to open an official case is there room

818
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:39,000
there is for precisely one more

819
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,166
15 pages near the end remain untouched by the damage

820
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,400
the checkered grid forms a structure of passages

821
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,466
breaking the case into sub-tasks to accomplish 

822
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:51,300
commit to paper

823
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,733
the tasks you've completed

824
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:55,166
flow out of the pen in a brash free hand

825
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,000
similar to the rest of the letters

826
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,933
the wording comes easily

827
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,766
it's almost robotically simple

828
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,600
a language developed for mental rigor and simplicity

829
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,366
inspect the victim's body

830
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,066
get the body down

831
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,533
interview the cafeteria manager

832
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:12,933
we done all that

833
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,366
a satisfying slash sounds across the paper

834
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,797
you're done it seems to say

835
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:20,066
 and you

836
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:21,333
and you

837
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:25,700
fucking yes we are we are reinforcing accomplishments

838
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,266
in a satisfying way

839
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:28,266
this is good for us

840
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,100
things to be done and things already done

841
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
the composition of reality

842
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:38,400
this is an extremely useful tool for a detective of the Citizens Militia 

843
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,900
now all that remains is to name the case

844
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:42,733
let's do it

845
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,800
no actually any ideas

846
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,066
the furies are at home in the mirror

847
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:50,966
that is what the opening line of this game was

848
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,266
the Hanged Man the setting sun shit on a stick

849
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,600
let's see what some of those other names were

850
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,100
let's pick one that's pretty fitting

851
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,700
the guys on a couch in an unexpected location

852
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,533
the murderer the hookah parlor collapsing tenement

853
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:12,500
feel like this is the most realistic one 

854
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,266
for my guy

855
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:19,066
it's simple it's as simple as like

856
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,200
like the robotic wording here

857
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,300
this is a little too like this would be for me

858
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,291
so let's go with this one

859
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,222
 great that's great  

860
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:32,400
that's actually what I was thinking too

861
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:33,774
the hangman 

862
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:35,366
good strong name

863
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,800
we have a very good name for the case now

864
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,260
wait a second I'm feeling

865
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,960
I'm feeling

866
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,900
strangely comfortable around Kim after this interaction

867
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,240
his admission that he also names things in a weird way

868
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,680
that doesn't always make sense

869
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,218
and that he does so at the expense of

870
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:59,760
empathy towards the people involved in the case

871
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,330
is something I can relate to

872
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,940
and now that he is telling me

873
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,200
that this is a good pick for it 

874
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,930
maybe he's just doing it because he wants me to relate to him 

875
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,300
maybe he's just trying to get me to trust him

876
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,730
I don't know I don't know guys

877
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,930
I'm starting to feel like

878
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,360
I want to trust him

879
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,460
I want to believe

880
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,460
that what I'm feeling towards him is true

881
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,900
I'm just not ready yet

882
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,860
I'm scared

883
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,100
I'm going to start calling it the Hanged Man

884
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,960
it's good we sorted this out

885
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,700
I don't know guys

886
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,560
there's something here I feel conflicted 

887
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,330
I want to trust you Kim

888
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,860
you don't exactly *close* them

889
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,330
so much as a *distance* yourself from the smelly papers

890
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,860
they're a little further from your nose now

891
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,700
can I read the case files now probably not

892
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,400
can't do that one either

893
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,260
let's uh let's check out those yellow papers

894
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,360
in the back you see thin translucent copy of paper

895
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,960
some neon yellow

896
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,700
some bright red

897
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,200
all covered in boxes like marching armies

898
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,260
these look like official forms waiting to be filled out

899
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,400
Three the topmost are misconduct finds

900
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,930
the middle ones are station calls

901
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,930
and the bottommost are field autopsy forms

902
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,400
each is easy enough to make sense of

903
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,900
all right let's check them out

904
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,010
misconduct fine

905
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:45,460
a monetary penalization ranging from 20 to 250 real

906
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,130
severe cases allow for 1000 real

907
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,860
but that requires special paperwork

908
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,660
the details of issuing these finds are spread out

909
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,460
over the rest of the fields

910
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,130
wait a misconduct fine

911
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,730
these are quite sinister in tone

912
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,200
they give a date and time for the person to 'appear'

913
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,730
at the specified precinct police station

914
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,960
below the 'call'

915
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,300
are the criminal charges you risk by 'not appearing'

916
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,130
a dozen pages of thin copy paper

917
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,560
bright red in colour

918
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,800
you see the parameters of a deceased human form

919
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,200
waiting to be filled in

920
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,460
age sex condition of internal organs

921
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,160
so these are all like blank pages

922
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,660
waiting to be filled out

923
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,460
okay yeah these are like empty forms

924
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,260
predation marks

925
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,000
condition of sexual organs

926
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:53,800
"close"

927
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,200
all that remains now

928
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,100
is to fill those forms and *hand* them to people

929
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,930
fines for wrongdoers

930
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,660
oh let's fucking fine all the children

931
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,560
and field autopsies to dead guys

932
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,560
what delicious power hid within this pathetic mess

933
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,660
you feel better

934
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,300
I do feel better

935
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,400
thank you authority

936
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,448
I feel a sense of authority over my own past

937
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:20,960
 and interpretation of how to integrate it with my presence 

938
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,500
the rest of the stinking cellulose is much worse for wear

939
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,900
being sandwiched between the board and the rest of the paperwork

940
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,530
must have spared the fragile copier paper

941
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,360
let's give that ledger a smell 

942
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,560
the acidic stench of rotting food

943
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,560
has rubbed off on the cellulose

944
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,530
it now forms the *base* of the experience

945
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,400
this base surrounded by a faint air of spoiled meat

946
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,560
the stuff of death itself

947
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,760
and then sprinkled liberally

948
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,360
with the citrus zest of toilet cleaner

949
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,160
you don't exactly close them

950
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,600
so much as it distance yourself from the smelly papers

951
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,160
they're a little further from your nose now

952
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,700
uh 28%

953
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,600
I mean I've got Kim's confidence he explained it to me

954
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,960
I can retry this one

955
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,160
I think I'm gonna go for the logic check

956
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,660
it's proving to be harder than expected

957
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,260
you just don't have the intellectual rigor to patch the quilt

958
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,530
my guy is an idiot

959
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,160
this is a white check as well

960
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,860
open the hidden compartment

961
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,460
let's see if we can pry that boy open

962
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,860
it is *not* what you end up doing

963
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,600
you squeeze the plastic to slide it open

964
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,200
but nothing happens

965
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,730
then you bend it some

966
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,300
then crack it

967
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,860
the goddamn thing is stuck

968
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,760
the Ledger quivers in your hand

969
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,060
as it shakes the pages rustle

970
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,760
this pathetic mess suddenly afraid of you for some reason

971
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,800
no my streamer luck is probably still intact

972
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,330
these are like not super challenging ones

973
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,500
watch me get like a 3 percenter correct

974
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,960
oh I actually have a skill point

975
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,260
what did I need for that interfacing

976
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,960
I don't think I need to open this thing right now though

977
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,000
I'm kind of curious what I should do 

978
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,560
kind of feeling like

979
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,130
authority and empathy are my two most interesting

980
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,930
outlets for understanding people

981
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,400
get that authority empathy over inland empire

982
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,200
that's exactly what I'm thinking right

983
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,400
if I'm going with a role play right like again

984
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,100
for those of you who are watching on YouTube as well

985
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:52,300
my goal is not to play this the most optimal way

986
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,860
I'm gonna miss out on shit

987
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,190
I'm going for comedy value more than anything

988
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,320
and like interesting character interactions

989
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,260
and to me

990
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,000
what resonates with the character I'm playing is

991
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,530
like I said someone who has severe trauma

992
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,000
and sees the world in terms of power dynamics

993
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,500
so I am thinking

994
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,100
I want a level of authority

995
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,930
even if it's not good for me

996
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,400
okay let's

997
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,100
let's ask Cuno what's up

998
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:33,930
it's been a while

999
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,960
look C it's the fucking war-pig

1000
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,930
try not to knock yourself f****t

1001
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,660
you belittled yourself before the Cuno

1002
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,660
now you must seek his forgiveness

1003
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,660
I've just leveled up my authority so

1004
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,330
I want to make this right with Cuno make amends

1005
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,530
let's try to put ourselves on an even power dynamic

1006
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,130
Ame-fucking-what pig

1007
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,160
it may not look like it now

1008
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,260
but you may have vital information

1009
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,560
I was trying I was wrong to try to hit you

1010
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,600
I bet no one in his life has ever said that to him

1011
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,730
yeah

1012
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,200
how are you going to make it up to Cuno pigshit

1013
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,960
let's give him let's give him free rein over this

1014
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,900
how do you want me to make it up

1015
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,100
please don't waste time on nonsense

1016
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,930
Kim this is important to me

1017
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,060
the lieutenant does not approve of this at all

1018
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,600
I don't care

1019
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,150
look in a displaced act of anger

1020
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,500
I tried to hit Cuno

1021
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,060
because I could not deal with my anger at myself of

1022
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,070
how unhappy I am with the world

1023
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,660
and so I drank myself into oblivion

1024
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,760
tried to erase my past

1025
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,480
and now I'm desperately trying to figure it out again

1026
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,700
and in that confusion I swung at someone

1027
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,960
and gave them an emotion that didn't belong to them

1028
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,360
I'm trying to make things right Kim

1029
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,630
if you want me to be at my best as a detective

1030
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,240
I need to do this

1031
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,200
don't listen to the blind fuck piggo

1032
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,130
you're doing the right thing here

1033
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,330
trying to get Cuno to like you again

1034
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:22,184
yes（个鬼啊）

1035
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:24,800
you can pay tribute to Cuno with drugs

1036
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,400
or cigarettes or some wheels

1037
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,280
Cuno could use some wheels

1038
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,200
motorized cabbage shit

1039
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,470
okay maybe if I get some cigarettes

1040
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,130
I can share one with them

1041
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,360
I need to make truce with Cuno offer him something

1042
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,560
no you really really don't

1043
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,700
that is a 12 year old boy

1044
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,600
his opinion of you doesn't matter

1045
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,240
ah so maybe there's a schema

1046
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,860
which is like a mental blueprint for Kim

1047
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,410
that the opinions of children don't matter

1048
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,960
I wonder where that comes from

1049
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,408
what opinion of yours

1050
00:50:02,408 --> 00:50:05,730
 did you have as a 12 year old that no one gave any attention to 

1051
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,100
Mr Kitsuragi

1052
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,360
I got your number

1053
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,800
you don't fucking matter Book-gimp

1054
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,090
I'm gonna mark it down as something I need to do

1055
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,130
I'm telling you I look

1056
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,360
I know how to spot trauma miles away okay

1057
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,330
Kim was a child who

1058
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,330
never learned that that his opinion mattered

1059
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,630
and so of course he's gonna look a Cuno and say

1060
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,140
yeah don't bother with this kid

1061
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,340
he sees himself

1062
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,100
but but why you're turning this into a huge thing

1063
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm punching someone always ends up someone's bitch

1064
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,191
don't you know anything about male power structures Kim

1065
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:51,060
 it's just very hard for me to let things go

1066
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,900
I know it doesn't matter but I need to make this right

1067
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,700
yes

1068
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,560
okay if you absolutely *need* to

1069
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,500
I absolutely need to this is part of my healing

1070
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,056
if you want me to be my best detective

1071
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,960
I need to do this

1072
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,060
okay

1073
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,930
we we got into the trash can we got some notes

1074
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,060
let's uh let's go confront the lorry driver

1075
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,930
I'm pretty sure that's what I needed to do next

1076
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,600
I need to bust down this union

1077
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,560
oh I that's right I didn't talk to the girl

1078
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,160
maybe she knows how I can make things right with Cuno

1079
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,300
this is the most important thing to me right now

1080
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,900
Cuno the pig's getting pretty close to me

1081
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,100
come to snuff my shit out I think

1082
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,700
looks like it's time for me to go Cuno

1083
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,260
pigs come to take me in

1084
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,060
I just want to ask you some questions

1085
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,300
I'm going away for a long long time Cuno

1086
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,000
going away for life

1087
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,400
what's going on there

1088
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,500
fuck are you trying to pull pig

1089
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,860
what are those strange words you use girl

1090
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,200
I come from the woods kytta vittu

1091
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,960
you don't want to go there with me

1092
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,460
you don't want to see what I've seen

1093
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,860
don't be traumatizing here

1094
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,560
get the fuck out of here

1095
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:07,930
okay

1096
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,560
all right

1097
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,300
look I can't I want to get on Cunos bad side already

1098
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,400
he already beat me up once

1099
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,600
I'm trying to make amends with him here

1100
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,370
let's go

1101
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,860
let's go up north here and see what's going on

1102
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,560
look what you can't say about Cuno is that he's not loyal

1103
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,530
looking for something runt

1104
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,800
come to tell me to fuck off again

1105
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,930
I found this mug in the trash yours

1106
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,730
oh man

1107
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,060
that's great look at that guy go

1108
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,160
I haven't seen anything that funny in a while

1109
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,530
is it yours

1110
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,800
God damn

1111
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,960
thanks for that but no

1112
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,800
no it's not mine

1113
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,800
fuck

1114
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,710
let me see the soles of your boots

1115
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,060
been admiring the stompers runt for sure

1116
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,160
I can *demonstrate* them

1117
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,660
on the bottom of the man's boots

1118
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,220
you see an intricate tangle of treads

1119
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,130
with no immediately discernible pattern

1120
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,300
wind howls over the Bay of Revachol

1121
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,900
a cascade of cold air flowing through the city streets

1122
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,100
those same streets have left their share of scuff marks

1123
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,500
on the underside of your green snake's skinned shoes

1124
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,130
is that a map of Revachol

1125
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,300
it sure is

1126
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,600
where did you get boots like that

1127
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,660
custom-made cost me a pretty penny

1128
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,500
but why

1129
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,000
you'll see when the time comes officer

1130
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,400
*true* patriots carry Revachol in their very soles

1131
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,330
technically

1132
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,660
you're stomping on Revachol every step you take

1133
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,300
I know you people don't understand *poetry*

1134
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,780
what are you hauling in those lorries

1135
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,130
not much anymore

1136
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,910
I'm here to pick up some cargo

1137
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,280
but the workers are on strike so

1138
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,100
it's a sit-and-wait-on-your-ass situation

1139
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,300
how long has the strike been going on

1140
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,160
I'd have been at it for a while

1141
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,500
a month two months maybe

1142
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,900
but this here is just the last week or so

1143
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,700
all right

1144
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,530
what kind of cargo he's supposed to be doing

1145
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,700
yeah apples I take it you had other questions

1146
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,660
he's given you the run-around

1147
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,960
let's be honest

1148
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,260
you were bested

1149
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,400
fuck off

1150
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,130
rhetoric I know that

1151
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,130
what's your stance on drugs

1152
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,600
I don't let anything pollute my body

1153
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,160
you know where that she comes from

1154
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,160
he's got a cigarette

1155
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:51,130
they take the money from our local junkies here

1156
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,730
and then use it to out-compete us

1157
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,800
in the manufacturing sector

1158
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,260
they know they can't beat us in a fair fight

1159
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,600
so they have to get us to weaken ourselves somehow

1160
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,900
it's racial sabotage racial *economic* sabotage

1161
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,460
he's not gonna just

1162
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,440
he's not gonna respond well

1163
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,690
if I just confront him let's just

1164
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:19,000
he eyes you warily unsure how to respond

1165
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,660
this goes on for about two seconds

1166
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,860
I don't know shit

1167
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,300
if I did I wouldn't tell you

1168
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,760
what are you still hanging around here for

1169
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,500
what do you think I can't leave the lorry unguarded

1170
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,860
stuff's been getting looted lately

1171
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,060
is those little kipts sneaking around at night

1172
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,060
if they touch my stuff

1173
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,930
the bosses will be on my ass like as cancer

1174
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,930
there was a bunch of spilled boxes in the back of a big lorry nearby

1175
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,000
I did see one lorry with the trailer doors open on my way here

1176
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,900
do you know what happened

1177
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,060
I knew that guy

1178
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,360
he was an honest driver who loved his country

1179
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,460
we were having a good debate about genetics

1180
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,760
at the Whirling-in-Rags

1181
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,750
when some kipt-boys smashed his lock

1182
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,160
and took them near everything

1183
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,700
lost his fucking job over it

1184
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,060
since he left him I haven't had anyone to talk to

1185
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,940
bad for him I guess

1186
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,000
I could just ask him who's running drugs what

1187
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,360
I know he's not gonna give me a real answer

1188
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,800
I just want to see how he reacts

1189
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,960
isn't it obvious

1190
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,960
fuckin 'Siileng that beady-eyed South-Samaran

1191
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,800
his little side business is a scam

1192
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:34,260
I wouldn't be surprised if he was pedding drugs as well

1193
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,190
he's the Samaran guy

1194
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,930
who likes to pretend he's some kind of businessman

1195
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,130
oh it is he's just selling his employer's stuff

1196
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,960
stuff he *stole*

1197
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,360
after he broke the seals on his Humanox lorry

1198
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,900
alright where do I find this guy

1199
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,530
just follow the smell

1200
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,360
it smells like apricots and *oil* when you're nearby

1201
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,330
yes yes where is he

1202
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,400
looks like I offended your partner there

1203
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,100
too bad Siileng's usually a little bit south of here

1204
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,300
near the canal

1205
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,330
you can't miss him

1206
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,070
just watch yourselves

1207
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,660
his tribe are natural liars

1208
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,330
it's in their blood

1209
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,360
he's your man alright 100%

1210
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,500
I wouldn't be so sure about it

1211
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,930
not until we've heard what siileng himself has to say

1212
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,060
goddamn another thing I have to do
