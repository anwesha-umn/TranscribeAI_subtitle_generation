1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,000
okay

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:04,700
hello and also welcome

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,266
it's great to be back on stream

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,666
and continuing our Disco Elysium play through

5
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:12,366
if you're just joining us

6
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,666
which is a good chance that you are

7
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,733
this is kind of still at the beginning of our little play through here

8
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,866
and what we're doing is we're kind of playing through it like

9
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,333
mix of role play mix of psychoanalysis

10
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm Brady I'm a therapist

11
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,300
and I'm going to be doing different kinds of

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,700
psychoanalysis on the characters

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,233
and kind of linking that to the game design

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,333
and like how it represents mental health

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,600
this game is just in another league

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,266
when it comes to that sort of thing so far like

17
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,400
I already did a video

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,166
kind of talking about the skill system and how it represents this like

19
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,766
very fascinating way to perceive like

20
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,466
motivation and psychological priority

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
so yeah we're like

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,066
we're gonna get pretty deep with this

23
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:01,500
the last two playthroughs or last two streams

24
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,100
I'm sort of just been figuring out the game and

25
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,866
now that I've like had some time to collect some thoughts on it

26
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,133
I'll be talking a little bit more about the

27
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:12,700
the characters and their dynamics and

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,025
like I guess why my character specifically is 

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,100
showing a lot of avoidance and confrontation and like

30
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:27,400
is not maybe making some of the best decisions

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,666
I'm doing like a mix of my own headcanon role play like

32
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,566
I'm not trying to play the game the best way

33
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,200
honestly I'm just trying to make this fun

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,700
a fun play through like just kind of doing wild shit

35
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,600
we're not going to see every single part of the game

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,733
or every dialogue tree

37
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,966
and that's okay you know

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,800
but it has been great to get some recommendations

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,433
for things that like I just straight out missed

40
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,533
because of like

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,433
so far my character has just fallen into like

42
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,700
he's just failing upwards basically

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,000
like passing some of the early skill checks

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,500
some of the comments on the last video were telling me that like

45
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,566
missing or succeeding in some of these early skill checks has like

46
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,600
made me skip over a lot of tutorials

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,266
which makes sense

48
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:18,000
because I kind of feel lost on some of the systems

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,966
but that's okay

50
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,333
we're discovering it as we go

51
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:27,200
and I think that just makes for interesting play through dynamics

52
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,300
what I have been fascinated by is how well 

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,200
the game has responded to my

54
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,333
weird way of approaching

55
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,600
it's completely fine that I skipped certain things

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,566
it's completely fine

57
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,733
that I don't know how to play it very well

58
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:42,333
it's not like

59
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,733
I've not reached a roadblock 

60
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,000
where the game is like hey slow down friend

61
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,133
I need to teach you this before you move on

62
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,733
and it's happy to just let me move on and

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,166
try to fail my way through everything which

64
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,300
is kind of life

65
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,775
isn't it

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,600
with that said that's kind of where we are

67
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,466
let's get started and continue our playthrough

68
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,600
okay so I'm just gonna recap for myself because 

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm gonna be honest I uh

70
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,733
I was very confronted by my last interaction

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,300
with this madam on the boat 

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,333
what I understand

73
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,333
is that we're trying to do right now is

74
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,333
get the information she has about the hanging

75
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,033
and to do so

76
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:31,300
she has basically convinced us that

77
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,600
we need to stop drugs from moving into her port

78
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,166
wonderful boat lady yeah

79
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,466
okay let me give you a little bit of insight into

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,666
why I'm making certain decisions like this

81
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,366
and what I think about 

82
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,333
some of the character dynamics so far

83
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,566
just gonna find my way back to the center here

84
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,466
let's go in here

85
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,533
a nice quiet place to talk

86
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:02,533
okay

87
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,166
so

88
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:07,805
some of the dialogue choices that 

89
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,975
I've made have come from a place where 

90
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm trying to get into the mind of my character

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,100
who is basically like

92
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,533
what I imagined to be very insecure

93
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,800
about his lack of memory right

94
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,200
he's meeting a lot of strong personalities

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,966
he meets Kim very early on who

96
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:30,200
has these very strong convictions

97
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,300
he meets the girl on the boat who

98
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:38,066
is like a professional and sticks to her script very well like 

99
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,733
we were not able to get her to flex very much 

100
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,400
on what she was willing to tell us

101
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:47,466
we met Cuno and Cunoesse two characters who like

102
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,385
whether we like it or not

103
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:54,211
 are very passionate in their way of 

104
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,060
communicating and representing themselves 

105
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,700
in my head Canon like my character has

106
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,966
met a lot of strong personalities

107
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,400
and that's something that he

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
currently doesn't have right

109
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,366
it's sort of like compensation

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,900
we're trying to present ourselves as like 

111
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,966
the detective that we can hope people assume we are 

112
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,733
not the detective that we know we are

113
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,333
we lost our fucking badge we don't have a gun

114
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,933
we look like a fucking goofball

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,966
with our coat and our gloves and our crowbar

116
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,466
and and we're just like failing our way through

117
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,866
every successful encounter

118
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:40,600
and so that's kind of like

119
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,733
where the dialogue is coming from so far

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,766
it's kind of hard to tell what you really think in the moment yeah

121
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:50,666
so

122
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,066
what I want to do is get a look at this thought cabinet

123
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,266
this is something I hadn't actually looked at yet

124
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,666
how do I like this background music

125
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,700
 it's very very calming and relaxing

126
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,133
okay so what am I looking at here this is like

127
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,866
there's only one thing in here that I can click on

128
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,266
temporary research bonus plus 1

129
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,933
empathy towards Kim Kitsuraki

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,533
here's the thing about me and Kim okay

131
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,966
we're on kind of rocky terms he and I

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,400
he ah

133
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,700
he's a complicated character to me because

134
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,800
every single other person who I've met

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,933
has been immediately confrontational of me right

136
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,770
they've immediately been like

137
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,166
able to identify that I'm kind of a fraud

138
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,600
but Kim is this person who like immediately gave me his 

139
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,500
trust and started giving me responsibilities

140
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,550
which I find very suspicious 

141
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,000
as a traumatized addict 

142
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,133
Kim's a professional you're a bumbling semi competent druggie

143
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,465
well here's the thing right and 

144
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,300
this is human nature

145
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,166
human psychology

146
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,800
and it's something that I experience in my practice

147
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,066
in the addiction space

148
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,833
is that people who have lots of trauma

149
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,666
and who maybe come from

150
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,133
abusive homes or sorts of things like that

151
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,166
they naturally have a lot of trust issues

152
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,600
like someone coming up to them and immediately telling them

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,866
I'm here to help you

154
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,200
I'm always gonna have your back

155
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,500
that brings out an immediate sense of distrust

156
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,100
and so what you will find people do kind of subconsciously 

157
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,800
is they will naturally push that person away right by

158
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,366
being very vulgar by being very confrontational by

159
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:02,100
sort of pushing and testing the limits

160
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,297
and what they're essentially doing maybe without knowing  

161
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:08,766
is they're trying to prove to themselves

162
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,200
let's say you know

163
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,066
Kim walks into my life

164
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,500
and he says I always get your back

165
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,400
and I don't trust him

166
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,533
and I push him to his edge and he abandons me

167
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:17,566
and I can go see

168
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,533
that fits my worldview

169
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,066
that fits the trauma informed worldview that 

170
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,500
everyone is always going to abandon me right

171
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,500
like we naturally tend to do that

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,733
that's something that I experience all the time

173
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,733
especially when I work with clients who are

174
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:34,500
maybe court ordered to be in treatment or something 

175
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,733
who don't necessarily want to be in therapy

176
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:41,466
there is a kind of resistance that they express to like

177
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
you know

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,200
why why do you want to help me

179
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,666
what do you get out of this right

180
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,100
and you kind of just have to push through that

181
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:53,333
when you actually push through

182
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,266
and show that person

183
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,066
it doesn't matter how vulgar you are

184
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,466
it doesn't matter how much you push me away

185
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:01,100
doesn't matter how much resistance you give me

186
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,800
it doesn't matter if you tell me every single day

187
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,500
that I'm a piece of shit and

188
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,400
you think I'm exploiting you right

189
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:12,100
if you stick with that person and continue to show them 

190
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,666
what we call unconditional positive regard

191
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,814
they start to see that okay 

192
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,600
there is actually a way for me to trust someone

193
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,533
I don't have to be so guarded

194
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:31,700
because even though I can be a bit of a pain sometimes

195
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
this person's not gonna abandon me

196
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,300
and then you've established a kind of rapport with them right

197
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,500
and so that's kind of how I imagine the detective to be

198
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,866
like I don't know his backstory yet

199
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,266
but it seems like he doesn't have a lot of people in his life

200
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,175
it doesn't sound like he's got a very 

201
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,533
structured support system right 

202
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,233
so like it's natural for him to be

203
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,185
mistrusting suspicious avoidedant and resistant 

204
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,733
to new relationships okay 

205
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,933
this is actually how real psychology would

206
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,600
position these two characters

207
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,100
it would not be natural for me

208
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,800
to just immediately be like Kim is my best friend 

209
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
because he says he's got my back

210
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,266
no like it's much more natural for someone traumatized

211
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:14,500
to actually push that person away

212
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,500
over and over and over again until

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,066
that resistance fades away and we establish that kind of rapport

214
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,133
or maybe he is just a really cool dude I mean

215
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:30,900
could just be that too

216
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,466
clears up a lot how you're interacting with Kim in this playthrough

217
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,700
well exactly right like

218
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,000
that's the way that I am interpreting my interactions with him

219
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,700
you know where I'm like

220
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,100
okay Kim you're gonna tell me 

221
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,766
you're gonna tell me that I'm responsible in this

222
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:48,300
exchange with the lady on the boat right

223
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,566
and then you're going to take away that responsibility

224
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,800
see I knew it no one trusts my capability

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,300
that's the psychological mind like that I'm working with here right

226
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,900
it's not natural for me to believe that someone would trust me

227
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,266
yeah it's a bit of role playing

228
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:16,466
my Esprit de Corps part immediately told me he has my back well

229
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,500
yeah I mean that's that's true right

230
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,466
yeah I mean a real world experience so like

231
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:31,166
it was one of my first days at a new job once

232
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,900
and and I walk into a a group room you know

233
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,666
I'm about to like do my first round of

234
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,666
group therapy with a bunch of people who

235
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,400
you know maybe come from department of corrections

236
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,266
who have criminal histories

237
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:45,366
who are struggling with addiction like

238
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:50,066
they're the kind of person that I'm talking about who

239
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,966
you know they present a hard exterior

240
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:55,500
but there's a lot of psychological fragility there

241
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
and they are naturally going to like push back

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,933
against anyone who walks into their life

243
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:03,500
especially like someone who looks like me

244
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:06,300
and and like is going to be very distrusting 

245
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,566
that I have good intentions or that I'm earnest

246
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:11,166
or that I even know what the fuck I'm talking about right

247
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,300
and I started telling them a little bit about myself and

248
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,133
was telling them that I studied overseas and that sort of thing

249
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:23,900
and someone had kind of said to me like

250
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,266
oh do they wear those like

251
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:30,600
high water pant leggings over there too

252
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
because I was wearing pants and like

253
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,533
the leggings were not all the way to my feet

254
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:37,866
like you could see some of my shin

255
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,366
or not my shin but like my ankle

256
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,466
and I could tell that they were trying to do this

257
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:45,666
they were like trying to see what my reaction would be

258
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,733
making fun of me in a group setting

259
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,000
and all of the other people in the room laughed

260
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,833
and I have two choices here right

261
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,300
like I can like try to be defensive and

262
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,766
lose my chance at making rapport

263
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,266
or I can sort of like show them that

264
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,266
it doesn't matter how hard you push me

265
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,700
you know I'm still gonna like be here to help you

266
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,166
so I told them no

267
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,366
they don't they don't wear these over there

268
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,200
that's just me I'm still growing into these

269
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,600
and I gotta laugh out of that

270
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,450
and from then on I never once got any of these people 

271
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,266
trying to challenge me the same way 

272
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,400
they kind of realized

273
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:28,700
okay this is a safe person to push the boundaries with

274
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,933
and pushing the boundaries is not going to turn them away right

275
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:34,600
and I haven't gotten that moment yet from Kim

276
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:37,666
I'm still a little suspicious of him

277
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:42,866
I'm still a little bit hurt and fragile and

278
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:46,333
I'm not sure that he's gonna stick with me

279
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,700
in fact there was a line of dialogue

280
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:52,666
is there a way to like see past dialogue

281
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,866
is there like a dialogue record or something like that

282
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,366
I don't know if there is

283
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:06,300
but there was a line of dialogue in the last exchange

284
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,600
 with the lady on the boat

285
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
that said like

286
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,933
there is a limit to the amount

287
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:16,933
that Kim is willing to let your impulsiveness

288
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,466
like derail this investigation

289
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:26,766
and I don't remember what part of my psyche my skill system

290
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,400
was informing of me of this

291
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,945
but that is the exact layer of suspicion

292
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,866
 that I'm talking about right

293
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,400
where I'm pushing his buttons I'm really testing the waters

294
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,533
with how much I can truly be myself and still be accepted

295
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,200
and there's a part of me that wonders

296
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:50,766
is he really with me because he trusts me 

297
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,800
and he's actually there for me

298
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,100
or am I a means to his own personal ends right

299
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,000
like as Brady the player

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,333
I'm not like really that I don't have a personal bias against him

301
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,300
but as the character

302
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,133
I can see that expressed this inner resistance to

303
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,333
people who on the surface seem very trusting

304
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,066
apparently you need to get racist to get a reaction out of him

305
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,066
might have been empathy yeah

306
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,200
but you see where I'm coming from right

307
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,466
this is something that I experience a lot of my work

308
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,133
and I feel like it's coming through with our lead detective here

309
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
so let's look at this thing

310
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,800
the thought cabinet

311
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,666
it looks like I only have one thing that I can really do in here

312
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:48,233
the insulin civiliar war was not the first war

313
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,900
to see the use of aerostatic aircraft on both sides

314
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,100
but it was the longest 

315
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,533
for eight years folded

316
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:57,566
multi rotor aircrafts crisscrossing the air above Revachol

317
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,766
and the Arcade Islands

318
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,500
they made sweepsilver sandy beaches

319
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,533
and shot each other out of the blue sky

320
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,000
then sank as wrecks to the bottom of the sea

321
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,100
the Ace's High was a custom on the revolutionary side

322
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,500
performed by squadron mates after landing

323
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,333
lieutenant kitsuragi likes it why is that

324
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,200
that's the problem

325
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,700
so

326
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,066
what we can do here is I guess internalize

327
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,300
this thought and what does that do

328
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,866
it gives us empathy

329
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,866
ah you spend time thinking on them

330
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:51,333
okay so this just happens passively I guess

331
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,933
let me get another look at that

332
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:09,666
why does kitsuragi like this

333
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:13,566
perhaps this story or this

334
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,866
narrative represents something he identifies with

335
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,500
keep my eyes peeled for that

336
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,100
let's see what she's got to say

337
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,333
hello sweetie

338
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,200
immediately distrusting

339
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,700
I'm immediately distrusting

340
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,266
wait who's sweetie

341
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,166
yeah who the fuck is sweetie you talking to me

342
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,400
why you are officer

343
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,666
I'm no sweetie look at me

344
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:46,166
see the self deprecation see the immediate lack of trust like

345
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,533
this is as much a lowered self esteem thing as it is like

346
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,366
an inability to integrate positive feedback from other people

347
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,866
because we always think there's a secondary motive

348
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,766
you're a handsome man officer

349
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:03,600
with your moustache and your chiselled jaw

350
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,333
and that silly dimple on your chin

351
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,066
dimple or not I'm a bitter man

352
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,600
the years have taken their toll

353
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,566
that simple dimple has only brought me suffering

354
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
ooh I want to know what the story there is

355
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,150
love can be cruel sweetie

356
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,266
 love can be cruel

357
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:33,766
I don't like that she's interpreting my life story

358
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,066
you mean this grandma on a wheelchair has alteriative motives

359
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,166
absolutely she does I can tell

360
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,000
(you must forgive me I am)getting so scatterbrained

361
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,933
I completely forgot to introduce myself

362
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,100
so I'll let her introduce herself

363
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,500
and then I want to tell you something else about

364
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,633
how like first impressions work psychologically and why

365
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:01,600
I don't have trust issue

366
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,400
okay maybe I do have a couple trust issues

367
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,866
but I'm speaking from the point of view of the character here

368
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:06,766
I'm Lena

369
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,933
my husband Murell and I are staying with our friend Gary

370
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:11,133
just down the street

371
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,900
but I come here for tea when they're away

372
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,758
this Lena is wacky enough for the motley crew

373
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,400
hire her on the spot

374
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,933
okay I like that idea

375
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,266
hey old Winter King thank you so much for the sub my friend

376
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:33,866
enjoy your early access to these streams and

377
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,133
all other content that comes to the channel

378
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,266
you seem to be in a chair

379
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,000
how'd you like to roll with me

380
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,700
yes dear I'm a paraplegic

381
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
what is a paraplegic

382
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,866
I was also informed by many commenters that like

383
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,466
there's no drawback and just continuing to explore dialogues

384
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,700
so I will be doing that

385
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,900
because I guess it raises my

386
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,033
chances of clearing some of these like crazy checks

387
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:14,000
it means I can't use my legs

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I was in an accident some years back

389
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,166
injured in the line of duty as they say

390
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,766
were you a mountaineer

391
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,933
nothing so glamorous dear

392
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,566
so when I was young

393
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:32,066
I dreamt of planting the Revachol flag on some figurative peak

394
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,366
oh they can hurt my chances too well

395
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,733
we'll just have to figure out how that goes

396
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,266
what did you do that

397
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,933
(I was a)training and development manager

398
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:46,200
at a rapidly expanding mail order shoe company

399
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,066
you'd think it would be a safe job

400
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,800
but I had to be everywhere

401
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,166
and well once I happened to be under some faulty scaffolding

402
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,733
so it was an accident

403
00:20:58,933 --> 00:20:59,733
I was lucky

404
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,566
this was almost 20 years ago when

405
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,733
I was compensated exceptionally well

406
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,333
one can only dream of such payoffs nowadays

407
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,133
could I become a paraplegic

408
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,400
I hope not although the work you are doing

409
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,900
for all of us is quite dangerous

410
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,966
here's another thing yeah she's admiring me a lot

411
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,300
towering over her in your insignia

412
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,200
you make her feel safe

413
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
 maybe this paraplegic

414
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,333
uh get up is just a way to disarm me

415
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,500
let's see authority speaks to me okay

416
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,566
as the character it speaks to

417
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:53,466
it's one of my competing mental states that

418
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,333
most of the time demands like immediate action

419
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,166
it wouldn't be so bad hanging out in a chair playing pinball

420
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:07,366
I've been trying to avoid my responsibilities with that

421
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,000
I know but that's what I'm saying 

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,066
it's it's disarming me by making it

423
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,533
making me seem like you know she's not a threat to me

424
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,133
she not a threat to me physically but she could be emotionally

425
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,900
I'm not sure I should be in this line of work

426
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,466
that seems pretty earnest

427
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:29,900
(you're a man)at the peak of your physical and intellectual powers

428
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:33,466
you'll find another call in yet I'm certain of it

429
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,200
doesn't that mean authorities not speaking to you

430
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,000
yeah maybe so I don't know

431
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,866
okay thanks for clearing that up for me

432
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,066
there is no bitterness in her voice

433
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,566
she accepted the curiosity her condition inspires a long time ago

434
00:22:56,866 --> 00:23:00,566
okay I have just demonstrated exactly what I 

435
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:01,900
talked about which is

436
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,133
I wasn't sure if I could trust her

437
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,500
and so I pushed her boundaries right

438
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,000
I asked myself is she a safe person

439
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,066
what if I call out something that

440
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:14,966
I think would make her uncomfortable right

441
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:16,133
like her condition

442
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,400
and I make some weird remarks about that

443
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,333
and she continues to be honest and admiring me

444
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:25,500
and my sense of empathy has come out to say okay

445
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,766
you make her feel safe

446
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
that was authority and empathy is like

447
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,100
disarming me from perceiving her as a threat

448
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:38,133
like the game just demonstrated exactly what I was talking about

449
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,300
like basically perfectly

450
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,266
this game is so fucking good like what the fuck

451
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,366
okay now I'm in

452
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:46,166
let's go

453
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,466
roll with me I want you to be in my wheelchair partner

454
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:51,333
fight in fighting crime helping people

455
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,666
catching sequence killers

456
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,366
roll that's some cigarettes

457
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:00,866
phenomenal cohesion between you with the game

458
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:03,333
that's what's like blowing my mind is like

459
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:06,333
it seems like every thought I have

460
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:10,033
the game is giving me like a very prompt reaction

461
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,733
or demonstration of that

462
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,400
I think she could roll us a couple cigs

463
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,533
but I'm gonna now I'm trying to establish

464
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,166
that rapport with her right

465
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:25,866
the danger in what I talked about

466
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:28,266
where you push someone's boundary and

467
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,675
like you establish that they are a safe person after all 

468
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:35,266
once you confront them and they stick with you

469
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,233
is now there's a danger of me

470
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:44,166
having a like overly attached perspective of them

471
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,233
because I'm like

472
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,566
oh well I just found the one person

473
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,900
in my life who has not pushed me away

474
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,500
or abandon me once I pushed on them

475
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,533
now I'm going to attach to myself to them forever

476
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:04,466
and that's the other side of abandonment and trust issues is

477
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:06,366
we develop codependency

478
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,166
sequence killers oh my

479
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,933
but I think you already have a partner sweetie

480
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,133
what this this fucking guy

481
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,965
Kim has not shown me yet 

482
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:21,500
that he's going to stick with me

483
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,700
a partner who needs you

484
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,166
to get back to helping the people of Martinaise

485
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,533
see don't like

486
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,200
that's what I'm talking about okay

487
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,125
here I'm trying to make a very important connection Kim

488
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,200
this is like one of the only people who has not like

489
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,866
immediately given me suspicion

490
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:40,400
even the little girl in front of her little bookstand

491
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,866
with her cursed house

492
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:43,450
set me on edge okay 

493
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,100
she wanted something from me

494
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,166
she asked me to go in the store

495
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,400
she wanted me to buy things right

496
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:51,790
everyone is out to exploit the detective 

497
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,850
except this perfect lady here 

498
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,666
who has not given me any reason to doubt 

499
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,566
her admiration for me

500
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:02,933
and here I have Kim

501
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,233
wanting to cut short that reaction

502
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:06,300
because we've got  bigger things to do

503
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,933
I've got problems with Kim okay

504
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:13,700
he's getting in the way of me and my healing here

505
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,366
I know I know but there are side mysteries

506
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:19,766
sequence killers into the paranatural

507
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,700
maybe I should be a little sarcastic

508
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,400
again I'm trying to push Kim

509
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,566
I'm trying to get to that moment

510
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:28,766
where he shows me that no matter how difficult I am

511
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:29,800
he stays with me

512
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,000
yes and it seems to me that you do well to stick close to him

513
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,166
he has the look of an upstanding officer of the law

514
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,500
someone you can lean on

515
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,166
and sweetie you are looking unsteady

516
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,600
the way she calls me sweetie

517
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,366
I wish she was my mom

518
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:51,933
and even if he weren't there

519
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:54,333
I don't think you'd have much use for me

520
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,333
why 3 heads are better than 2 please come along

521
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:03,666
Martinaise isn't the most wheelchair accessible place you see

522
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:07,333
I'd slow you down perhaps another time

523
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,466
see how much I'm opening up to her now that like

524
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,066
I consider her a safe person

525
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I don't know if you've noticed

526
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,700
but I don't know where I am or what I'm doing or anything

527
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,100
like that's one of the most honest things that

528
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,366
my character has come up with to say so far

529
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,733
yes officer you look rather dazed

530
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,966
like a stun fox

531
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,766
but surely things can't be that bad

532
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,500
I'm now being perceived

533
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,466
she won't judge you no matter what she say

534
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,933
this game reads my fucking mind dude

535
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:50,233
there is a kind of safety comfort and anxiety

536
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,900
in the way that she perceives me

537
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,166
safety because

538
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:57,266
I can tell that she can see through my rugged exterior that is

539
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,466
desperate to convince you

540
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:02,566
that I am competent and healthy when I'm not

541
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:05,066
but also a kind of anxiety which is

542
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,166
someone from the outside is looking in and showing me that

543
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,833
my sense of security of self and health is

544
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,266
a facade even to myself right

545
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,366
and now I trust this woman

546
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,666
and she's like hey you don't look so good

547
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,966
and I'm starting to think maybe she's right

548
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,666
I drank so hard I forgot literally everything

549
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,000
oh my

550
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,533
you know where we are right

551
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:37,666
we're in Revachol

552
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,066
that's right

553
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,933
in a hostel called the whirling in rags to be precise

554
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,266
honestly I don't know diddly squat about Revachol

555
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,800
I've learned some things about Revachol

556
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,333
but not from the right people so far

557
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,066
what I've learned is that there are no schools in Revachol

558
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,433
and the kids have nothing to do

559
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:04,333
but hang around and insult adults all day long

560
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,000
and that this place is full of racists

561
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,800
and sad poetry boys like Tommy

562
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,600
I want to know what grandma thinks about this

563
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
how would I even begin to tell you

564
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:21,500
Revachol is the most beautiful city in the world

565
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,566
(We're)fortunate to be here you and I

566
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
what a fucking light in the darkness her perspective

567
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,066
I am clinging to it now

568
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:31,133
do you see how rapidly I'm getting attached to her

569
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,866
now that I've considered her safe

570
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:35,666
I haven't seen very many other cities personally

571
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,933
but everyone says so

572
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:40,766
Revachol is a rare jewel

573
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,000
this city used to rule the world

574
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,733
though it has seen better days

575
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,200
it's fascinating that she says this

576
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,100
because every other character has pointed at Revachol as like

577
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,100
a place where things are dying

578
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:00,100
even the ones who are optimistic like Kim

579
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,400
he sees like a cultural value to this place

580
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,600
but he still feels like it's dying

581
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,866
like it's losing its cultural value because of people

582
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:11,666
like the racist lorry driver

583
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:15,266
like everyone sees Revachol in a state of decline

584
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:16,300
except this woman

585
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:19,066
speaking of history

586
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,566
you know what year it is yes

587
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,466
it's a bad year in my late 40s or 50s

588
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,200
I don't even know how old I am

589
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,966
let's go with that

590
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:33,900
there there the year is 51 and spring has only just started

591
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,333
I'm sure there are better days ahead

592
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:37,333
are you saying the

593
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,800
MC is just overthinking and afraid of negative things

594
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,400
but the lady shows that the negativity is a false alarm 

595
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,566
specifically for her

596
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,200
no I think that

597
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,866
my character's perspective is that

598
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,100
I can trust this lady and I trust her optimism but

599
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,900
I can't live in the world that she perceives

600
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,866
right not the way I am

601
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,566
she she has been able to make peace with her trauma

602
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:06,200
the way that she talked about like

603
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:09,300
you know I am a paraplegic now and

604
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,400
the fact that she has

605
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:15,333
endured that experience and remains optimistic

606
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,766
that is something attractive to my character as insight

607
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:20,866
potentially

608
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:23,100
there is a way for me to be okay with myself

609
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,966
even though I am extremely flawed

610
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,733
and I'm broken in a way that I will never get better

611
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,150
that's kind of why I imagine he asked like 

612
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,326
can I be a paraplegic 

613
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,766
it's kind of a comedy line but

614
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,533
there's a little bit of like

615
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,100
can I be like you

616
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,666
like would being a paraplegic make me feel better

617
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:49,800
because I would find the kind of peace in my trauma 

618
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,466
and disability that you have

619
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:56,200
like this game is so good

620
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,933
like a single line of dialogue like that

621
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,166
tells me so much from a therapeutic point of view

622
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
I want to be like her because

623
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,766
she's found a way to make peace with this

624
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:11,266
and it doesn't matter that she is unfixable

625
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:13,800
she still feels

626
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,800
okay with who she is

627
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:20,866
the lieutenant studies you rubbing his chin

628
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,408
yeah what do you see Kim

629
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,866
I'm beginning to suspect that you might 

630
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:27,666
indeed be completely adrift in this reality

631
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,300
thinks the lieutenant

632
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,533
how can it be that bad

633
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,066
never mind we're in this now

634
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,366
see he's sizing me up as well

635
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,866
I imagine that Kim is experiencing a very 

636
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:40,900
similar thing as our detective right

637
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,600
he's wondering like in a similar way 

638
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,733
this person is very chaotic

639
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:50,500
what will happen if I test their limits

640
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
will they stick with me right

641
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,326
the lieutenant doesn't seem to have a lot of

642
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:56,766
people in his life either 

643
00:32:57,733 --> 00:33:02,133
outside the melting snow seeps into the cracks in the woods 

644
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,133
and the cobblestone streets

645
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,700
all the way down into the sewers

646
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:10,000
above ground the first May bells blossom

647
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,533
you can feel it

648
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:15,600
a great cold then the shiver passes

649
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,666
whoever told me to speck into shivers was a genius

650
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,000
I love this perspective

651
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,333
I can tell that this is taxing for you

652
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,400
so I'll just ask one more question

653
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:30,700
what regime are we living under what mode of government

654
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,566
definitely not a democracy

655
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:36,933
I'd like to think that it's the dictatorship of the proletaria 

656
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,500
but something tells me it's not

657
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,500
fierce warriors

658
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,500
governed by intelligent machines that

659
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,500
perform calculations to determine the freeest market

660
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:52,400
radios are being used to control people's minds

661
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,400
cop we're living under the cop regime 

662
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,166
um let's

663
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,766
let's get her opinion

664
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:08,566
this is the only one that is not a statement

665
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:09,400
it's a question

666
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,200
so

667
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,605
maybe if I say it she'll enlighten me

668
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:17,500
nope sadly not

669
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:21,133
Ravishal is what's called a zone of control

670
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,000
I knew it under an alliance of foreign powers

671
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,400
called the coalition

672
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:28,100
we have no government of our own and

673
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,366
what democracy we have is

674
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:32,300
market driven

675
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,066
there's no government how come there are cops

676
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,333
I don't even know what to say I'm so disappointed hmm

677
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:42,066
uh let's see

678
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:43,933
should I go with

679
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,366
oh dear this is troubling

680
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,566
you really ought to know that being one yourself

681
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:56,600
there aren't any cops in Revachol

682
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
not in the traditional sense

683
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,300
the status of law enforcement has been

684
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,933
a complicated matter since the revolution

685
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:04,966
okay

686
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,366
just giving me good context here

687
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:10,466
this lady is like informing me of things that

688
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:11,533
no one else would

689
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,800
and I finally feel safe enough with a person

690
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,733
to let them know that

691
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,866
I am completely ignorant of these things

692
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,133
like I couldn't tell the fucking boat lady that

693
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:22,280
I don't know why I have a job 

694
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,566
 but we should stop for today sweetie

695
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,500
you look like you need a break

696
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:27,604
she sees me

697
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:30,733
I'm not the best person to explain the big things to anyone 

698
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:33,200
look how honest and humble she is

699
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,533
and she sees me she can tell how fatigued and sad I am

700
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,100
she's scared now

701
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,866
she's realized you really are brain damaged

702
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,776
so how did I do you

703
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:48,466
 didn't do too well dear

704
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,500
it does look like you're having

705
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,133
trouble remembering things

706
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:54,366
history and places

707
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:57,238
remembering reality in a word 

708
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,866
it's very odd

709
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:00,366
a sigh

710
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,933
the lieutenant bears his nose in his notebook

711
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,400
see there's another thing that I'm not sure about Kim

712
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:12,366
the way that she spoke to me just now

713
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,966
she's giving an honest reflection

714
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:22,200
and she's empathizing with me

715
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
whereas Kim is showing me disappointment

716
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,733
and he's showing me mistrust

717
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,300
like maybe I am too brain damage

718
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
to be used for to him

719
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:35,900
but maybe a fresh set of eyes is what the world needs

720
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,100
and while I'm no doctor

721
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,533
such bouts of amnesia are often temporary

722
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,966
so I wouldn't worry too much

723
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,500
solid positive reframing there

724
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,300
Lena

725
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:49,966
oh my god her name is Lena

726
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,866
I just realized that

727
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:58,466
wait wait a second this is some Inland Empire shit

728
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,333
of course I am immediately magnetized to the character

729
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,300
named Lena

730
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,100
there's no way

731
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:11,766
this is eerie

732
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,666
this game is eerily deep in my psyche

733
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,100
you mentioned that three times

734
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,400
I didn't see that comment

735
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,200
for those who have no idea what I'm talking about

736
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,133
my favorite anime of all time is 86 

737
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:30,300
and I am obsessed with the main character Lena

738
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,533
she's one of the most well written characters I've ever seen and 

739
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,800
I have spent many many hours talking about

740
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,100
the psychology of her character and 

741
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:42,666
why she's so relatable

742
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:46,366
and here I find myself gravitating to another Lena

743
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:49,600
in a completely different medium this is weird 

744
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,500
she means this sincerely

745
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,600
worrying won't do you any good

746
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,650
what is this revolution you mentioned

747
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,966
a defeat I'm afraid

748
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,066
the people of this archipelago tried to build

749
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:05,533
something new something different 

750
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,200
the rest of the world didn't like it

751
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,166
so they came and ended it

752
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:12,900
this was 42 years ago

753
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,325
but I'm a cop whatever it was hasn't stopped me

754
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:18,400
of course sweetie

755
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,866
I really don't know how to explain it better

756
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,698
I'm just a poor woman she thinks 

757
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:28,533
 what do I know of these things and how can I help you 

758
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,100
Lena

759
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:33,666
you have helped me more than you could ever know

760
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,600
and I only wish the game gave me a way

761
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,700
to tell her that

762
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,200
that she's she's someone so far who has

763
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:45,989
finally given me some secure grounding in this lost world 

764
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:49,933
 someone more educated in sweeping matters

765
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,766
maybe you should ask

766
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,600
oh yeah you want me to ask him

767
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,866
no I'm not an encyclopedia

768
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,533
I won't be a guide eater

769
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,133
I'm a detective

770
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,333
okay setting up clear boundaries with me

771
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,775
I can respect that but it doesn't bring us any closer Kim 

772
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,766
of course then I don't know 

773
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:09,566
someone rich maybe

774
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:11,700
well though people are educated

775
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,125
though I don't know where you would find a

776
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,133
 wealthy person in Martinaise

777
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,333
I've got to get going now

778
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,700
I'll come back for you Lena of course dear

779
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:23,600
good luck with your case

780
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:29,333
I'm gonna cry dude Lena's the best

781
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,300
do you think the MC should worry more

782
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,266
or do you think the MC shouldn't worry too much

783
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:35,266
like Lena said

784
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,366
I will talk about that later I want to talk about

785
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,966
how my character is experiencing anxiety

786
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:51,133
like some of the dialogue choices that he is making

787
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,500
not just me as the player but

788
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,733
some of the dialogue choices it presents to me

789
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,600
I sense a lot of anxiety and what he's saying

790
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,966
and I want to talk about how anxiety works

791
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,933
and what the behavioral responses

792
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,733
I kind of rushed out of here earlier

793
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,066
so I kind of want to see

794
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,950
if there's anything else here

795
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,500
 real mature man

796
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:17,700
what exactly were you trying to accomplish

797
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,566
you do understand you still owe me money right

798
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,933
oh shit I hope I haven't consigned myself to paying him

799
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:28,333
damn your feet thought we got away

800
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,766
oh fuck so I

801
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,225
I got away with it and 

802
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,425
now I have stumbled my way back into 

803
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:37,825
just having to pay it anyways

804
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:39,466
that doesn't seem fair

805
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,200
you demonstrated some serious skills there

806
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,366
slipping away Sam Bo style

807
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:46,566
yes Sam Bo

808
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,066
by the way Sam Bo or Samaran boxing

809
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:54,133
is an eloquently violent set of one on one fighting moves 

810
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:56,767
originated from the Samaran Isola

811
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:58,700
Sam Bo used to incorporate

812
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,000
a wide array of martial disciplines

813
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,300
from archery to mounted combat

814
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,766
but mainly means aesthetically pleasing single combat nowadays 

815
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,400
Sam Bo style implies stealth cleverness and cool

816
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,500
I like the sound of that I want to be cool

817
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,766
I want to be very cool

818
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,400
maybe I can lean into the whole I'm brain damaged thing

819
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,900
what are you brain damaged

820
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,166
what the fuck this is so weird

821
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,766
this is so fucking weird

822
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:39,966
oh my God

823
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,585
how is this happening okay

824
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,300
no I'm just getting my bearing see how my responses

825
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:57,133
like are different compared to these people

826
00:41:58,566 --> 00:41:59,600
trying to show

827
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,266
confidence here

828
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:06,166
money is what growing up people use to pay for things

829
00:42:06,466 --> 00:42:09,100
things like this hostel room or

830
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:13,875
or eight bottles of Potent Blend and nine packs of Royal Extra

831
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,784
we use it for everything really

832
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,000
where can I get money

833
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,933
 are you serious

834
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,100
from your work I don't know

835
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:24,966
you can take bribes I guess

836
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm sorry I'm not above bribes cops take bribes

837
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,100
I'm actually not above it take recompense

838
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:32,533
I don't need to survive

839
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,950
why do I need it

840
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,200
 for survival to pay me

841
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,500
unless you want to become a hobo

842
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:40,666
do you want to become a hobo

843
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,866
there's nowhere else to stay in Martinaise

844
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:44,733
and it's a cold spring outside

845
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:46,966
money doesn't make you happy

846
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:50,133
but it lets you be unhappy for a bit longer

847
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,866
holy shit this guy's got wisdom

848
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,800
if you run out of money you die

849
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:59,625
it's like that for all of us me too 

850
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,766
 that's why I need you to pay me

851
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,900
I'm not an asshole

852
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:06,675
I don't think I have anything

853
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:08,300
there's a shuffle of nylon

854
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,115
as Lieutenant Kitsuragi looks for something 

855
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:13,900
in the pockets of his orange bummer 

856
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,400
 that's cop for

857
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,820
I haven't offered to pay 

858
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,300
because I don't have any money either 

859
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,800
I'm sorry I know it was irresponsible for me to run

860
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,133
you have to understand I was desperate

861
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,533
okay so

862
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:35,500
having the capacity to apologize

863
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,700
is not an easily adopted trait

864
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:43,066
I'm gonna have to pursue that one

865
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:44,300
you know what

866
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,900
the stupid drinks you've had are on the house

867
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,366
you know why because I know you can't pay for them

868
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:52,266
not because you ran away

869
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,575
can't you see I'm struggling out here

870
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,066
I still have to charge you for three nights

871
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:58,466
and the broken window

872
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:00,100
that's 100 square

873
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,266
thank you for your cooperation

874
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,425
so we're cool 

875
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:06,666
not entirely cool

876
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:08,733
used to owe me 100 Real

877
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:10,566
if you don't have it by tonight

878
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,333
I can't let you back up there

879
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,475
oh I can't come back

880
00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:14,700
now what the hell did you want

881
00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:17,675
I assume you wanted something to come back here

882
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,700
is the trash container out back yours

883
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,750
oh I wanted to get inside that trash container

884
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,166
mine no it belongs to the whirling and rags

885
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:32,466
thank you for clearing that up

886
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:34,866
why do you keep the container locked

887
00:44:35,766 --> 00:44:38,533
why to keep the hobos and drunks out

888
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:39,410
that's why 

889
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,966
and the neighbors too

890
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,400
they put that trash there

891
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,666
and they don't pay for the garbage company

892
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,533
wait why are you guys surprised what

893
00:44:47,966 --> 00:44:50,666
you didn't know you could do what it's so funny

894
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:53,900
I seem to be making like all of the weirdest decisions

895
00:44:57,533 --> 00:44:58,900
I thought as much

896
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:02,200
and are you the only party with access to the trash container 

897
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,566
well yes us and the garbage disposal company

898
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:08,600
ah the garbage disposal company

899
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,533
see that's the thing

900
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:12,000
you gotta ask yourself who benefits

901
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:15,100
it seems a little callous doesn't it

902
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:17,266
something stirs in you

903
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:19,966
I wonder what this feeling is

904
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:21,350
no it doesn't nothing stirs in me 

905
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,366
and it isn't callous  it's common sense 

906
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,700
I did stick a point in rhetoric

907
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:28,675
sort of desperately hoping

908
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:31,666
 it would intrusively give me some insight

909
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:32,800
so I'm gonna pursue this 

910
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
prod at him and find out

911
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,300
ah yes

912
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,800
doesn't it seem callous to you

913
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,725
guarding even your leftovers from the poor

914
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:43,425
 callous

915
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:46,466
what are you Kras Mazov

916
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:49,000
almost all establishments in Revachol

917
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,500
keep their trash locked

918
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:53,866
the whirling and rags is not special in that regard

919
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,200
we need those keys

920
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,733
it concerns the case please cooperate 

921
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:01,966
just bring them back once you're done please

922
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,133
look at that look how far an apology goes to

923
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:13,725
I've seen something here at the Whirling Gart

924
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:15,585
I think I need to talk about 

925
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:17,075
what thing

926
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,391
the mess hall is reserved for the union

927
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:24,733
not the whole union thank god

928
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,366
just the nastiest and loudest faction

929
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,545
they come here in the evenings 

930
00:46:31,545 --> 00:46:33,733
dumb unruly types

931
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:35,333
think they are big shit

932
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,300
but they are good customers

933
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,266
they place big orders and always pay on time

934
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,933
he hates the union

935
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,800
but grudgingly recognizes it's power over him

936
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:49,166
so he is directing his frustration at you instead

937
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,650
retaliate 

938
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,800
I love that

939
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:55,500
authority pops up a lot for my character

940
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,900
which tells me that my guys

941
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:04,395
way of organizing relationships between people  

942
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:06,566
is all about power dynamics right

943
00:47:06,566 --> 00:47:08,100
in fact we even saw that with

944
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:09,933
Lena the woman in the wheel chair

945
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,133
which is like

946
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,655
when someone has had some sort of trauma

947
00:47:15,655 --> 00:47:18,330
 where their sense of control has been taken away

948
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,333
 potentially this is like you know 

949
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,466
sexual abuse or maybe

950
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:27,566
bullying or

951
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:30,766
abandonment

952
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:32,933
any of these things that have left the person

953
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:37,066
feeling like they did not have control over a situation

954
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:43,455
that's what they tend to organize relationships as later in life  

955
00:47:43,455 --> 00:47:44,933
but in a very sort of

956
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:47,766
unadjusted way

957
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,566
and so every time

958
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,733
I have an interaction with other people

959
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,766
I'm looking for the power dynamic

960
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:55,500
I'm finding this woman in the wheelchair

961
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,200
and I'm immediately like yes

962
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,466
I have this power over relationship with her because

963
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:04,675
I can stand and you know she can't 

964
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:12,866
I have a questionable power relationship with Kim 

965
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:18,566
he sometimes gives me a false sense of authority

966
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,966
telling me like it's your case detective

967
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:22,600
like you need to do the line of questioning

968
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,666
but then he revokes it

969
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:24,733
and so this is like

970
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,066
I'm not sure where I stand with him

971
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,600
as I look at Garte and the union

972
00:48:29,966 --> 00:48:32,266
that's what my character is latching on to is like

973
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,966
what is the power dynamic here

974
00:48:35,966 --> 00:48:38,775
like he understands why Gart is in this position 

975
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:42,300
because he hates the union but recognizes their power over him

976
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,866
and he's also doing something

977
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:49,266
called displacement

978
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:52,366
which is something that I kind of want to talk about

979
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:57,166
really quick I'll just briefly bring this up

980
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:03,000
because it's relevant to what this character is saying right now 

981
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:12,200
I want you to look at this line

982
00:49:12,966 --> 00:49:14,133
he hates the union

983
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:16,733
but begrudgingly recognizes its power over him

984
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:20,390
so he's directing his frustration at you instead 

985
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,900
so

986
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:35,800
when someone is directing something at you instead

987
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,500
what he's talking about there

988
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,566
is kind of like a

989
00:49:40,966 --> 00:49:43,600
cognitive distortion called displacement

990
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,733
this is what we call it

991
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,300
so displacement is the idea

992
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:53,733
that we tend to have an emotion

993
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:57,266
which has a target

994
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,866
like for example

995
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:04,825
if my boss is telling me I'm not a good worker

996
00:50:04,825 --> 00:50:08,200
 and I don't do my job well

997
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,675
 and I am easily replaceable

998
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:14,766
the emotions that I'm having are ones of anger

999
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,000
or frustration or

1000
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:21,366
resentment

1001
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:26,333
but this is not a safe target for this emotion

1002
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:29,866
because there's all kinds of consequences if I act on this anger 

1003
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,266
if I yell at my boss and I get in a fight with him

1004
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:34,533
I could lose my job

1005
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,700
and I could lose my livelihood

1006
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:38,166
there's a lot of

1007
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,400
anxiety that interferes here

1008
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,400
kind of subconsciously

1009
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,600
so this is not a safe target

1010
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,466
the anger does not just go away though

1011
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:55,400
what happens is it gets redirected

1012
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,100
it gets displaced to a safer target

1013
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:05,333
which is often the people closest to us right

1014
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:06,666
this is the classic like

1015
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,800
I got in trouble at work

1016
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,500
so I go home and I yell at my partner

1017
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,333
or I yell at my kids right

1018
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,100
a lot of people who do not know

1019
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,900
how to resolve this emotion

1020
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,300
when they can't act on it

1021
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,866
what they do is they just collect it and they store it

1022
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:21,700
and they deliver it somewhere else

1023
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,466
to someone that they are going to have

1024
00:51:23,466 --> 00:51:25,400
less consequences dealing with

1025
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,333
that's exactly what he's talking about here

1026
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,966
when he says

1027
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:34,200
he hates the union

1028
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,066
so he's directing his frustration at you instead

1029
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,733
I'm the safe target

1030
00:51:41,733 --> 00:51:45,933
because he can't retaliate against the union itself

1031
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:48,000
he'll lose his own livelihood

1032
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,133
he'll lose his own power and status right

1033
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:54,733
and the way that I have kind of described this to people is 

1034
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,560
I guess the way I say this is like

1035
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,733
 how you are supposed to deal with this in the aftermath

1036
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:08,000
like let's say I come home and I yell at my partner

1037
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,933
right the way you apologize to this is you tell them

1038
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,600
you know I'm sorry

1039
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,933
I gave you

1040
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,133
and emotion

1041
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:26,933
that didn't belong to you

1042
00:52:30,066 --> 00:52:31,025
and that wasn't fair 

1043
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,900
I collected this anger from 

1044
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:38,266
my workplace and from my co workers

1045
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:40,266
and from the people who wouldn't stand up for me

1046
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:42,466
and the fact that I don't have any money right now

1047
00:52:42,466 --> 00:52:45,766
and that's a self directed anger

1048
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,500
I directing this emotion in all these different places

1049
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,266
and none of them are safe targets

1050
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:54,133
but for me today you were the safe target 

1051
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:55,900
and it wasn't fair to do that

1052
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,400
like I gave you this emotion

1053
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:59,200
and it didn't belong to you

1054
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,533
and I just don't know how to deal with this yet

1055
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,733
that's exactly what is happening here

1056
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,700
that's what authority is telling me

1057
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,366
is what's happening here right

1058
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,520
he's directing his frustration at you instead 

1059
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,400
it's asking me to retaliate

1060
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,400
and I think the reason it's doing that is

1061
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,400
I also have a lot of collected

1062
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,266
trauma and anger and frustration

1063
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:29,533
and I feel out of power dynamic balance with lots of people 

1064
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,366
and so he's the safe target for me right now right

1065
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:37,900
and earlier it was the dock lady and earlier it was Cuno

1066
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,766
Cuno happened to be my safe target to

1067
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,966
direct this displaced anger at the time

1068
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:45,266
and so I tried to give it to him

1069
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:46,966
and it didn't work out right

1070
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:53,200
I'm walking around with this reservoir

1071
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:57,366
of emotion that I've collected

1072
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,000
and when I experience something that makes me mad

1073
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,266
and it really deserves

1074
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,300
maybe this much anger

1075
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:08,133
but I get in touch with all of the anger that I have

1076
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:09,965
collected and not dealt with

1077
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:11,055
 and I

1078
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,166
explode with it right

1079
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,533
this is like kind of the foundational

1080
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:18,950
way I tend to deal with like anger management

1081
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,666
 is to understand where that anger comes from

1082
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:24,250
and why so much of it is being expressed

1083
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:27,700
when only this much

1084
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,800
really matches this situation that you're in

1085
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:31,766
and so I think

1086
00:54:31,766 --> 00:54:34,466
it would be displacement for me to retaliate here

1087
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:36,266
just like it was displacement for

1088
00:54:36,266 --> 00:54:38,266
me to retaliate against Kuno

1089
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:49,000
I've always conceptualized as having energy that will come out 

1090
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,100
so you have to direct it towards something constructive 

1091
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,466
well that's true

1092
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:54,900
the thing is

1093
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,133
is we don't always choose something constructive

1094
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:59,100
we choose something that's self destructive

1095
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,566
which you're talking about would be

1096
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:02,566
something called sublimation

1097
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,933
which is when you deal with a...

1098
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,766
displaced emotion in a socially acceptable way

1099
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:10,733
for example

1100
00:55:11,466 --> 00:55:14,150
instead of just handing this out 

1101
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,733
to whoever makes me angry in the moment 

1102
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,755
what I do is I take a boxing 

1103
00:55:17,755 --> 00:55:22,200
 and I get involved in an activity where I can start to let some of this out 

1104
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:26,266
and it's a socially acceptable task right

1105
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,933
that's what we call sublimation

1106
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:32,600
and in some ways I would probably say that

1107
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:39,000
being a detective is a form of sublimation for Raphael

1108
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,866
because it's where he gets to

1109
00:55:41,866 --> 00:55:43,966
act out in his socially acceptable way

1110
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,766
his sense of authority

1111
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,666
he's just not very good at it yet

1112
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,566
it's the right outlet but it's the wrong approach

1113
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:56,066
can we see his hands

1114
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:57,666
I've covered up his hands

1115
00:55:58,966 --> 00:56:02,200
how does this knowledge of this help a person

1116
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:04,000
who experiences it

1117
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:06,666
because you can start to recognize

1118
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:09,066
okay you know

1119
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,933
I got in an argument today

1120
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:13,166
and I gave someone a lot of my anger

1121
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,800
and I can you know when you come to therapy and

1122
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:18,500
we might engage in that dialogue

1123
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,800
like I might ask you who was that emotion for

1124
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,900
well it was for the person who cut me off in traffic

1125
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,700
right

1126
00:56:25,366 --> 00:56:26,500
and it's like okay well

1127
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,966
does the emotion of that event match realistically

1128
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:32,500
I would work with them on understanding that

1129
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:38,100
no this is a disproportionate release of emotion for the situation 

1130
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,700
and then we would start asking

1131
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,466
okay who is the real target

1132
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,500
a lot of times it's not

1133
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:47,533
my boss who I can't safely target it's

1134
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:51,100
it's my mom who has never been in my life right

1135
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,585
like it's a target that's not only maybe not safe 

1136
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:55,766
 but not available

1137
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,133
it could be society right it could be like

1138
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:01,935
I'm really angry at the economic system

1139
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:05,600
 but how do I express my anger to the economic system

1140
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,100
well it's not like I can directly go punch it in the face 

1141
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:12,800
but I might start developing very negative opinions 

1142
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,800
about bankers and CEOs and people who in a sort of

1143
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:23,265
symbolic way represent that institution that I'm very angry at 

1144
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:28,166
so how do you get rid of it

1145
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:32,600
can't punch capitalism yeah

1146
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:36,700
well you need to find something that works for you 

1147
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,600
in terms of this right here right

1148
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:42,766
we need to first understand that the anger or

1149
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:44,200
sometimes its grief

1150
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,333
sometimes its sadness

1151
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,966
like it's not just anger but this is a very common one

1152
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,800
we need to understand that it is being displaced

1153
00:57:52,266 --> 00:57:54,866
why it is being displaced at this person

1154
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:58,266
and then we can start figuring out what the outlet is

1155
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,366
 because everyone's going to deal with

1156
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,566
feelings of anger in a different way like for me

1157
00:58:07,733 --> 00:58:08,866
I like to run

1158
00:58:09,066 --> 00:58:12,300
when I go to the treadmill or out on a run like

1159
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:18,100
this exertion of energy and like the rush of endorphins

1160
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:22,666
it sort of like tempers the feelings that I have 

1161
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:23,566
and

1162
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,366
kind of lets me direct them into something productive for myself 

1163
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,700
it calms me down in a way

1164
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:36,566
talking about it 

1165
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,466
Sigmund Freud

1166
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,933
called the process of talking about something

1167
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:45,300
and the emotional release you get from it

1168
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:47,266
catharsis

1169
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,666
he also called it the talking cure

1170
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:56,333
because just telling the narrative of what happened 

1171
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:01,166
learning and understanding like why it happened is 

1172
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:05,900
something that in a lot of ways releases this reservoir for you 

1173
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,966
hey Van Zorkin thank you so much for the sub my friend

1174
00:59:17,733 --> 00:59:19,400
thank you thank you very much

1175
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:23,100
so yeah displacement right

1176
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:27,425
I think that that's what we're going to see a lot of in this world  

1177
00:59:27,425 --> 00:59:29,166
because it's very natural

1178
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,850
ways to deal with our emotion

1179
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:32,560
 and in fact

1180
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,900
sorry to keep going back to the game and back to this 

1181
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,533
but you can imagine like let's say

1182
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,933
I'm in an exchange with my boss

1183
00:59:39,933 --> 00:59:44,366
and I'm displacing that anger to you know my partner 

1184
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:46,900
and my partner

1185
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:49,866
let's say they got in an argument with their friend

1186
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:53,600
and they're displacing that anger towards me right

1187
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,066
essentially like

1188
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,733
I'm giving her a motion

1189
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,266
she's giving me emotion and

1190
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,400
neither of us are really the people that this belongs to 

1191
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,200
but we're the ones in an argument

1192
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:12,900
so often how relationships start to break down is

1193
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:16,800
partners not collaborating on what they're feeling and

1194
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,300
bringing displaced emotions home

1195
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:22,000
and not knowing how to deal with them

1196
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:26,566
is something that comes up a lot when I do like couples counseling 

1197
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,600
I've heard that having an outlet

1198
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,333
like boxing to release anger is bad

1199
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,566
because it makes you become violet

1200
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:42,366
well you have to know what you're doing and why 

1201
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:44,866
to get the benefit of acting it out right

1202
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:45,866
it's about like

1203
01:00:45,866 --> 01:00:48,333
knowing you're doing that with the intention of releasing it 

1204
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:52,900
and that being violent isn't the outlet it's

1205
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:57,500
learning to control the emotion right

1206
01:00:57,733 --> 01:00:59,666
like your perspective matters a lot

1207
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,733
you did pet the mailbox displaced affection

1208
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:06,133
yes 100 percent right

1209
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:08,100
good emotions can be displaced as well

1210
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,933
we've seen a lot of people angry at things they can't control 

1211
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:17,300
yeah totally right that's how I understand Cuno

1212
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,200
I talked about this very briefly when I was actually doing the 

1213
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:23,366
this discussion about the skill system

1214
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:28,166
my understanding of Cuno is probably that 

1215
01:01:28,466 --> 01:01:31,166
there's a very good reason why he's the way he is

1216
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,525
like he probably has a lot of displaced emotions  

1217
01:01:33,525 --> 01:01:36,600
and a lot of missing sense of control 

1218
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,755
and the way he gets that control backed 

1219
01:01:39,755 --> 01:01:41,900
is by getting a reaction out of people

1220
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:50,666
okay

1221
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,133
let's continue because I could talk about this stuff

1222
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,200
for a very long time

1223
01:02:02,366 --> 01:02:04,600
because we are self aware about our displacement

1224
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,500
I'm going to ask myself to let it go  

1225
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,266
let it go your above gratuitous baiting

1226
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:17,366
oh yeah sorry about that

1227
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,500
game is unmuted

1228
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,000
we don't we have to wait

1229
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,733
they'll show up sooner or later

1230
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:29,315
men get hungry

1231
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:30,700
 even striking men

1232
01:02:30,866 --> 01:02:33,266
if not today then they'll be here tomorrow

1233
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:37,000
something else I want to ask about

1234
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,350
by the way 

1235
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,200
you should come back to this thing based questionnaire 

1236
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,266
if you see anything interesting in the whirling later

1237
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,300
okay

1238
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,220
by the way I'm gonna sing karaoke here

1239
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,270
absolutely out of the question

1240
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,166
oh it's quiet I can raise the volume

1241
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,500
you wait and see cafeteria manager

1242
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,900
absolutely in the question

1243
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:06,366
first we find a sad banger

1244
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,800
then we sing this place to shit

1245
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:14,200
another thing great yeah

1246
01:03:17,133 --> 01:03:18,066
okay I can

1247
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:21,166
increase the volume a little bit

1248
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:30,900
that should do it

1249
01:03:31,966 --> 01:03:33,050
let me know if it's too loud

1250
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,800
 by the way where is home

1251
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,966
the address is coming up blank

1252
01:03:36,966 --> 01:03:39,533
and this place sure isn't it

1253
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,550
do I even have one

1254
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,300
 but you've been at this hostel cafeteria for only 3 nights 

1255
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,800
where were you before

1256
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,766
you had to be somewhere

1257
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:53,400
I don't know near south maybe

1258
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,200
you don't really know do you

1259
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,533
does this mean I'm homeless

1260
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:00,300
Nah we must have been somewhere

1261
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,066
a vague blackened image

1262
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:04,500
doesn't sound like somewhere you can stay

1263
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,333
if you run out of money

1264
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:09,466
that's a good point encyclopedia

1265
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:11,350
I live in a dumpster I don't care 

1266
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,966
fuck everything hobocop 

1267
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,200
let's find out

1268
01:04:18,466 --> 01:04:21,400
run some addresses in your head when you get the time

1269
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,733
maybe a street or an apartment will appear

1270
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,400
man this I have so many

1271
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,600
lingering like things to do this is crazy

1272
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:38,666
there's a couple other things in the thought cabinet now 

1273
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,505
I do want to talk about this

1274
01:04:41,505 --> 01:04:44,400
 but I think I need to be more acquainted with the system 

1275
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,366
before I give like a real breakdown about

1276
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:49,700
how this represents mental health 

1277
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,850
because I do have some thoughts on that 

1278
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,100
but I want to see 

1279
01:04:53,866 --> 01:04:57,900
what happens after I've internalized something

1280
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,966
thank you for watching my video

1281
