1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,100
okay

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,000
hello

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,166
and welcome to the beginning of

4
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:08,000
a special playthrough of

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,466
a game that I have been

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,400
kind of like talking about with my community

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,933
to play for a very long time

8
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,466
it is Disco Elysium

9
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,133
if you are just discovering the channel

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,133
based on this which is a good likelihood that you are

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,866
my name is Brady

12
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:22,666
I'm a therapist

13
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,566
and we are gonna be doing like kind of a long form

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,066
analysis of the game that we're gonna play

15
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,733
we'll probably play out the games in the future as well

16
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,600
and we tend to ask a lot of

17
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,559
questions kind of in the space of 

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,134
okay so

19
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:43,166
let's imagine this character was my client

20
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:43,966
like what sort of things

21
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,933
do I think that they would be dealing with

22
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,700
what sort of approach would I use to help them 

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,933
so that's kind of what we're gonna be getting into and

24
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,733
I also myself am interested in creative writing

25
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:56,766
I would say like

26
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,133
I'm an aspiring writer

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,766
I have a bit of an imposture syndrome around like

28
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,166
I don't know if I'd call myself an author or not

29
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,533
I did write a science fiction novel a couple years ago

30
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,466
it's finished

31
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,000
I didn't publish it

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,566
and I don't know if I will at this point

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,733
it's just so old

34
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,766
now that it would need like a full rewrite and

35
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,200
I still keep telling myself

36
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,533
to go back and rewrite it or write something new

37
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,866
and I know that that kind of parallels Disco Elysium as like 

38
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,100
this is not your average game writing like

39
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,200
there's a big focus on prose from what I can tell

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,600
I don't know anything about the story

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I actually don't even really know anything about the setting 

42
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,100
the only things I really know about it is that it has

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,866
a lot of acclaim a lot of for its like creative 

44
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:51,800
aspects for its like prosaic dialogue and narration

45
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,966
and that it's kind of a CRPG

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,166
I like CRPGs I'm a fan of Baldurs Gate and

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,133
Divinity series

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,800
I played original sin 2 a couple years ago

49
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,166
fantastic game

50
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm currently playing through Boulders Gate 3

51
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,933
really enjoyed pillars of eternity as well

52
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,366
so

53
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,933
those kinds of games I'm really into and

54
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,000
we have tried to play games on stream before but

55
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,466
just by the nature of like

56
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,900
discussing things from a therapeutic perspective

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,066
they can go quite long

58
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:28,800
so I'm gonna be trying to keep my thoughts a little more 

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,166
focused and concise

60
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,133
but yeah I hope you enjoy what you see here today

61
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,400
we're gonna be uploading this

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
kind of periodically and if you want to come

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,466
check out the stream

64
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,300
see it live you're welcome to do so as well

65
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,666
so yeah let's do it

66
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,500
let's get into it

67
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,200
let's go I'm ready

68
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,066
oh there it is

69
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,566
got my little Brady box in the corner there

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,700
hey Brady I haven't seen you live in quite a while

71
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,866
looking forward to you playing this amazing game

72
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,333
thank you I'm extremely excited to dive into this

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,200
so I've got the like streamer mode on

74
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,366
so we may be missing out on some of the original music

75
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,933
but that's just that's the nature of what we got to do 

76
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,000
hi Bertie you look so handsome today Kraith

77
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,533
you slay me Kraith it's so good to see you

78
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,733
I haven't seen you in ages in here

79
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,466
they want to move the camera to the top left

80
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,533
okay let's do that

81
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,766
and let's move the chat box here

82
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,800
hey king Yan

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,133
yeah we're we're finally getting to it

84
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,800
I've been promising that we'd be do we'd do this for

85
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,066
the fucking year now

86
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,300
okay

87
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,100
let's do it

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,300
select an archetype

89
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,600
oh it's a very Jungian and psychology

90
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,966
sort of thing

91
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:55,933
all right

92
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,766
the thinker extremely intelligent very bad with people

93
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,700
most interesting facts comes up with original ideas

94
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,500
okay

95
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:13,300
sensitive very psychological and magnetic personality but unstable 

96
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:14,966
okay I think this

97
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,666
this might be me right here

98
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:22,000
physical extremely physical interacts with the world through his body 

99
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,200
gets things done but dumb as a rock this probably not me

100
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,600
I don't get anything done with my body

101
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,900
I would say that no

102
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,733
bad with people is definitely not me

103
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:34,466
because by the nature of being a therapist

104
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,100
you have to be able to read people pretty well

105
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,866
any bets for how long the character creation will get

106
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,966
well do I go with an archetype or do I create my own

107
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,900
I mean this archetype kind of speaks to me

108
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,900
sensitive type

109
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't know if I'd say my personality is

110
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
exactly magnetic but

111
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,133
wouldn't do a create on the 1st

112
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,933
or some people are saying create your own

113
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,366
there's no need

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,000
yeah let's just go as sensitive it speaks to me

115
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,733
I'm ready to lose my mind here

116
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,066
the furies are at home in the mirror

117
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,400
it is their address

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,866
even in the clearest water if deep enough can drown

119
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,466
okay let's go

120
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,166
there is nothing

121
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,400
only warm primordial blackness

122
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,700
your conscience ferments in it

123
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:37,666
no larger than a single grain of malt

124
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,800
you don't have to do anything anymore

125
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,633
my ancient reptilian brain I love that

126
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,071
ever

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,900
never

128
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:48,266
ever

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,966
simply keep on non existing

130
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,400
this is like speaking to my fucking life right now

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,866
an inordinate amount of time passes

132
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,500
it is utterly void of struggle

133
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,166
no ex wives are contained within it

134
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,466
this is great

135
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,466
yes it is

136
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,100
you got it sweet brother

137
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,966
nothing upon nothing upon nothing

138
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,900
oh man the narration is phenomenal

139
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,566
how about you cough up some of that sweeter blue feeling let's go 

140
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,566
coming right up sir smooth passage

141
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,466
expand my little box here a little bit

142
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,300
feeling a little too con-

143
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,400
a little too like claustrophobic in the void

144
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,066
oh we've got a little bit of French here Alons-y

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,100
let's go

146
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,066
I mean I have to go with the French

147
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,800
alright Nothingtown to Fuck-All-Borough

148
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:06,533
return trip to the

149
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:10,200
do you want me to upgrade that to a one way trip sir

150
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,566
sing me the song of death

151
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:19,066
the song of death is sweet and endless

152
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,100
but what is this

153
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:26,600
somewhere in the sore bloated man meat around you

154
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,133
a sensation

155
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:31,966
okay

156
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:34,733
yeah

157
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,500
this is this is pretty good I don't know what I would

158
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,700
have to say therapeutically for someone who is

159
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,533
nonexisting just yet

160
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,400
so we'll dive into that later

161
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,533
like a fly to the ointment

162
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,666
your conscience sticks to it

163
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,930
the limbed and headed machine of pain 

164
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,166
an undignified suffering is firing up again

165
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:00,800
it wants to walk the desert

166
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:08,966
hurting longing dancing to disco music 

167
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,700
hmm

168
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,200
you can take it you're a champion

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,066
some of my things seems to be cut off there

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,466
there's a head attached to my neck and I'm in it

171
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,766
Jeez that

172
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:32,566
sensation

173
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:35,000
take me back to the formless disembodied nothing

174
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,466
I'm feeling decisive

175
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,766
I'm feeling decisively attached to my

176
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,266
nothingness take me back there

177
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,097
the stench of liquor rises from your mouth

178
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:51,866
and with it an ungodly headache

179
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,300
cut off my head it's trying to murder the rest of me

180
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,700
Jesus Christ

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,566
a fiery streak penetrates your skull

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,133
trying to force your eyes open

183
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:11,100
it's a sound a clarion call from hell

184
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,333
let's go

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,266
let's fucking go

186
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,733
I'm ready for this to get really really weird

187
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,500
relatable

188
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,400
okay

189
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:35,666
see what we got here

190
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,566
I'm gonna take some pants

191
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,333
gotta get some pants on

192
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,933
you hear a jingle

193
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:51,700
keys are clinking in the pocket of your flarecut pants

194
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:56,300
it says whirling-in-rags on the aluminium keyring

195
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,533
there is a single key on the ring

196
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,600
the No. 1 is etched on it

197
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,700
it should open the door

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,200
okay

199
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,866
my guy is very

200
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,333
observational

201
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,966
take a look at that bottle there

202
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:13,900
Johnny Disco

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,500
empty bottle checks out

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,300
whole time to tie that

205
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,100
okay

206
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,266
let's get a scope on that shoe

207
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,666
it's just one shoe

208
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,666
just go with the left shoe

209
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,400
what we got here

210
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,200
kind of music is jamming

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,866
get that jacket on

212
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,166
got a tie on the on the fan there

213
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,800
this fan has two chainful switches

214
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:08,566
one ends in a tiny fan the other in a light bulb

215
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,600
a truly horrific necktie has somehow attached itself

216
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
to one of the blades or

217
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,566
has it been consigned there as punishment

218
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,966
you feel as though this creature is your friend

219
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,666
and wants to reattach itself to your neck

220
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:27,300
so that you may continue your adventures together

221
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,133
in this strange world

222
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,366
okay

223
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,300
we're gonna go for the tie

224
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,700
you reach out to grab the tie but what is this

225
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,466
diffuse radiating chest pain

226
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,533
doom comes over you

227
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,700
that's my only friend right now that tie

228
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,533
this is bad

229
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,333
feels like sharp stones grinding in your

230
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,133
chest and keeping you from moving

231
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,717
all right my dude's got some problems so far

232
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:02,800
 for quite a long time

233
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,133
still ongoing

234
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
now is a good time to start worrying

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,500
finally the pressure recedes

236
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,566
you find yourself covered in cold

237
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,500
sweat and trying not to move

238
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,800
hoping it will keep you from dying

239
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,300
so what this immediately makes me think of

240
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,366
is the difference

241
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,866
and I guess the connection

242
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,933
like with the

243
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:23,766
like the nervous system

244
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,300
this is something I actually talk about

245
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,666
kind of often and in my work because actually a lot of

246
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,100
counseling that I do is

247
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,533
in the addiction space

248
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,400
one thing I'm always trying to get across to people

249
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,200
is that like

250
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,366
when you are of sound mind you make good decisions

251
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:44,400
right but as soon as your

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,866
bodily systems are disregulated for example

253
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,866
if you're feeling pain in your chest if you're feeling

254
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,333
confused about where you are if you're disoriented

255
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,903
if you're feeling isolated like 

256
00:12:56,903 --> 00:13:00,258
any number of negative things 

257
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:03,266
introduced to your nervous system will like

258
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,866
really impact your decision making

259
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:06,500
and so like

260
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,933
you may not put a decision on your personality and say

261
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:11,266
yeah I would do that

262
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,333
but we see

263
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,366
people make decisions

264
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,566
that are not always in their best interest

265
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:20,066
the limbic system was one of the voices at the start

266
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,700
yeah I was picking up on that I'm like okay

267
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,700
that opening monologue actually really was

268
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,566
pointing at like

269
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,533
there is a fear of your own body

270
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:34,900
getting across here like

271
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,666
the mind wants something

272
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,866
I want to pull down this tie

273
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,266
but my body cannot keep up

274
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,900
like I am I am reaching out for this thing

275
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,800
which I am going to call

276
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,500
my only friend in the universe right now

277
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,333
this fucking tie

278
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,700
and it hurts me

279
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,500
physically

280
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,400
I cannot just muscle my body into doing what I want

281
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,266
and that fear of your own body is

282
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,100
something we all feel and is terrifying right

283
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,300
like the whole narration about

284
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,133
I'm in my head and I wanted

285
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,566
to cut it off from the rest of my body or whatever

286
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,366
like

287
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,733
that theme of

288
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,600
the fear of not being in control of what your

289
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:17,900
automatic systems do and tell you you can't do is

290
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,500
really real for me

291
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,766
I'm a person who likes to be in a lot of control

292
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:25,333
we'll unpack that later

293
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,700
but I know that I can't just demand my body do things

294
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,066
sometimes it really rejects my decision making

295
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:34,366
okay

296
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,166
let's try the light bulb

297
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,966
a terrible mistake

298
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,266
turn the lights off immediately

299
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,200
you can practically feel the photons burn in a hole

300
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
you see what I mean

301
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,400
like you're not in a good decision making

302
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,266
space you're like ah wog

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,166
that's another part of this right

304
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:58,200
and your autonomic nervous system is is your eyes dilate right 

305
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,300
you're not in control of that

306
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,166
you cannot tell your eyes to dilate

307
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:06,966
you cannot tell your heart beat to raise or decrease

308
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,933
you can do things to yourself that

309
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,900
cause that reaction you can

310
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:13,966
pull on the light switch and

311
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:15,766
and blast your retinos

312
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,600
you can go from a dark room to a light room

313
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,133
or you can go jogging and

314
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,533
you know change your heart rate but like

315
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,100
you you can't directly influence

316
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,900
it's just a little hangover induced photosensitivity 

317
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,533
don't overreact

318
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,666
okay it feels like

319
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,266
the games speaking directly to me

320
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,975
okay let's let's turn the light off 

321
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,291
the lights are off

322
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,533
let's just leave I don't need the tie

323
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,166
I'm gonna leave the tie behind

324
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,266
what do we got here broken window

325
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,166
the window stands broken in its frame

326
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,133
cold wind blows in

327
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,066
visual calculus

328
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,066
this is a white check you may retry it okay

329
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,333
42 percent chance to succeed

330
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,733
the tie is my best friend what

331
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,166
being friends with him has brought me immeasurable pain

332
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,842
what do you mean assisted them

333
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:13,361
fuck

334
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:14,766
how would you do that

335
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,100
what are you even trying to do

336
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:21,199
why is this game like calling out me like this

337
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:24,852
I I am trying to meet its intellect and

338
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,994
it is vastly outpacing me right now

339
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:29,146
the morning light hurts your eyes

340
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:33,553
its hazy but you see the ocean and some war-torn buildings

341
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,266
fuck this I don't give a shit where I am

342
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,933
I don't care anyways fuck that tie

343
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,566
maybe I'll come back for it when my eyes have adjusted

344
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:47,666
see here I am

345
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,166
separate from the character

346
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,900
trying to figure out my environment

347
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,400
let's look in the mirror

348
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,500
what do I imagine will happen

349
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,733
he's going to be disgusted with himself

350
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:04,666
a mirror hangs above a bent and broken sink

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
in a fierce discharge of masculine energy

352
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,133
someone has ripped half the faucet off

353
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,416
hot water sprays from the base 

354
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,166
and steam covers the mirror

355
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,300
you cannot see yourself

356
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,200
just the outline of a man

357
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,000
suddenly you realize you have no memory of the face

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,133
that awaits you there

359
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,000
underneath the soft vapor

360
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
you know what

361
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,300
doesn't matter

362
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,000
not gonna wipe the mirror down

363
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:33,333
I'm not in a solid state of mind here okay

364
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,533
my parasympathetic nervous system is absolutely distraught 

365
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:44,133
so parasympathetic system is the one that is like

366
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,766
trying to cause the body to be at rest

367
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,366
like it's you know

368
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,666
it's trying to counter the sympathetic system

369
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,133
which is all about like

370
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,966
being very active

371
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,366
so it's your fighter flight

372
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,600
it's the thing that tells you you're in danger and

373
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,500
everything around me is in danger

374
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
like the environments fucked up

375
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,133
I don't know how I got here

376
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,900
I'm in pain making small adjustments

377
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:08,333
to my body like nearly kills me

378
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,666
I can't even get my best friend down from the fan like

379
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:16,000
my sympathetic nervous system is completely

380
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,000
in charge and it's disregulated

381
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,100
meaning I don't want to add any stress to that

382
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,100
what we got up here it's a shirt

383
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,400
let's go with the shirt

384
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,066
see if I can find my other shoe

385
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,066
give myself a heart attack with my own face

386
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,600
not yet see show

387
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,766
maybe maybe in a little bit I'll do that

388
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,500
oh okay

389
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,666
a little bit out of my stupor now

390
00:18:56,866 --> 00:19:00,366
my immediate reaction is to go to talk to the woman

391
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:02,466
let's do it

392
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:03,884
hello Officer 

393
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:04,884
officer

394
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,166
the young woman raises a cigarette to her lips

395
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:16,333
how is this game like literally in my brain it's like

396
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:20,666
the dialogue is literally the thoughts I have

397
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:25,100
there's only one solution to this

398
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,766
you're a businessman

399
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,166
gotta be a businessman

400
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
why'd you call me officer

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,166
because you're a police officer sir

402
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,500
are you sure whoa how would you be

403
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,666
I am yes

404
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,166
unless you've been feeding us a set of very well

405
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,733
rehearsed lies all this time

406
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,700
I could be

407
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,966
you've been here for three days

408
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:56,400
on official police business no or less

409
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:57,398
and what business

410
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:58,225
couldn't say

411
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,333
in truth so far

412
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,366
mostly drinking

413
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:03,333
checks out

414
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:12,566
I'm gonna role play a little bit here and assume that

415
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,166
I don't I don't want my guy to be

416
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:22,500
too forward with his self awareness right 

417
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,800
if I'm going with like the

418
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,933
psychological type I'm not gonna be like

419
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,266
too self critical

420
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,166
Let her know that I want her physically I don't think so

421
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,733
I kind of want to do it just for the meme but I also

422
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,733
I don't know if it would be fitting of my character

423
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,733
she wouldn't know

424
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,733
I'm just gonna leave

425
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:46,666
of course

426
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,066
be careful officer

427
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,600
they don't like the police around here

428
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:58,533
she looks back at you a light glinting off her eyes

429
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,066
goodbye

430
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:01,900
hmm okay

431
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,000
that was as awkward of an exchange

432
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:11,566
chance gone

433
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,300
is there like a really good line that she says

434
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,166
if you say that

435
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,533
it's March the year is 51

436
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,400
okay

437
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,866
I don't know if it would be in a

438
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,333
good psychological spirit to immediately try to

439
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,000
thrust myself into an attachment relationship

440
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,133
with a stranger

441
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,366
okay I wanted to check that out before I leave

442
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,900
where's my other shoe

443
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
I would like to make fuck with you

444
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:57,366
you should pick that fat juicy cigarette butt from the tray 

445
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:01,266
light it up and smoke the living shit out of it

446
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:05,500
holy shit okay this is actually like his nervous system

447
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,500
you can even see the diagram like literally

448
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,400
this is capturing exactly what the body tells the brain

449
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,133
like in addiction essentially like

450
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,166
right now his

451
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,466
his two nervous systems the

452
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,333
well there's central and the peripheral but 

453
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,600
within the peripheral system there's that like

454
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:27,666
parasympathetic and

455
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,866
sympathetic and they are fighting with each other like

456
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:33,600
he's introduced drugs or something into the system and 

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,100
right now his

458
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,866
sympathetic side the one that wants to stay active is like 

459
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:43,266
get up your in danger your brain hurts go do something

460
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,666
maybe go fuck someone

461
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,500
right that's what it's telling him

462
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:50,333
but his other side the parasympathetic is like

463
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,966
slow down

464
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,200
take a walk go to bed like

465
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,766
stop trying to push me harder than

466
00:22:58,366 --> 00:23:00,266
than I can keep up

467
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,533
and then his sympathetic side is actually like

468
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:04,700
smoke that cigarette okay

469
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,933
you're feeling down this will wake you up

470
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,966
smoke the living shit out of it

471
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,133
have a drug yeah keep this party going

472
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,933
the living shit

473
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,366
your mesolympic reward pathway does not mince words

474
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,800
who knows what you are

475
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,533
a monster a murderer the gnome of Jeroma

476
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:30,966
you feel like a smoker

477
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,366
especially when you look at that juicy

478
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,266
succulent seductive cigarette stub

479
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,066
still smouldering deliciously

480
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:41,333
yeah

481
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,000
how very astute of you

482
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,366
this renders it ineffectual

483
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:50,066
you should look for a whole cigarette

484
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,266
an entire pack

485
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,933
strike that a carton

486
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:58,533
make sure they're all healthy and able bodied

487
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
then smoke them all

488
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,533
how about I just go

489
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,166
fucking pocket the whole drug store at this point or

490
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,566
you could not do that

491
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,400
no one is making you

492
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:11,300
this is fucking good this is like literally

493
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,800
what I imagined the inner dialogue

494
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,869
of your body to be having 

495
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,068
like the electrochemical part

496
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:22,000
the the different nervous systems is like

497
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,333
I demand resources

498
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,300
I demand you keep fucking up this system

499
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,933
it's the only way I know how to thrive

500
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,166
but his volition like his

501
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,733
the part of him that is

502
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,533
almost invasive at this point of like

503
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,966
sound mind is like wait

504
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,466
maybe you shouldn't do that

505
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,966
I'll think about it

506
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,466
good

507
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:49,400
thinking about yummy cigarettes in the mouth is the

508
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,266
best this is great

509
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,566
make sure you think about juicy sticks of tobacco

510
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:56,200
all the time

511
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:59,266
it doesn't count if it's not all the time

512
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,837
this is literally the inner narration of addiction

513
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:03,100
 and when you're done

514
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,333
thinking about them

515
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,500
graduate to getting them

516
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,700
man I may actually need to like implement some of

517
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:15,066
this games like dialogue into some of my classes 

518
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:16,400
I literally work in addiction

519
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:20,866
this is like so good for explaining to people how 

520
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,800
the different parts of the body and the mind

521
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,000
are in competition

522
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,733
with one another for what your priorities are

523
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:32,100
smoking them gives massive bonuses

524
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:33,600
what kind of bonuses we talking

525
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,366
I need to get my hands on some cigarettes and

526
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:39,200
smoke them for those massive bonuses

527
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,000
this

528
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,766
game is reading my mind

529
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,600
find a pack put it in your hand

530
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,500
equip it in the held slot

531
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,966
and the smokes will do the rest

532
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:47,700
all right

533
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,100
well it looks like we're looking for some cigs

534
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,333
doesn't seem like I have any cigs at the moment

535
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,466
what did that say

536
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,400
is this my motivation on my motorics

537
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:02,466
I don't move my body very well

538
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:04,200
maybe if I had some smokes I could

539
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,515
let's scope the scope the apartment

540
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:13,381
the door is closed

541
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,800
this door can only be opened with a key or from the inside 

542
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,133
okay let's leave it

543
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,266
look at my real life

544
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,466
I don't just go banging on any door that I see

545
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,366
Trompe le Monde

546
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,866
uh I don't know what tomp means but Lemont is the world

547
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,800
good point about the window and the missing shoe

548
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,933
something on the table

549
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,866
what is it

550
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,766
oh some money maybe I can get some cigarettes with it

551
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,133
scope out my environment a little more here

552
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,366
hey there's the shoe

553
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,366
all right we're fully equipped now

554
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,466
some briny wind there's salt in there

555
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,733
there they both are

556
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,066
two identical shoes

557
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:30,766
both copiously green and indiscriminately snakeskin

558
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,933
reunited on your feet

559
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:36,900
these do not look like normal cop shoes

560
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,733
I mean not much is normal about my dude

561
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,466
good they're balanced comfy

562
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,533
feels like the only good thing about you right now

563
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:45,766
Jeez

564
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,933
not quite fully equipped

565
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:55,666
smell of the sea makes me dizzy

566
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,000
well and that's the other

567
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,000
thing about the nervous system is like

568
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,533
anything you introduced to it like

569
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
imagine my

570
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,066
sympathetic side which is

571
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,766
about staying active and responding to threats

572
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,200
if I smoke a bunch of meth okay

573
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
that's the side of my nervous system

574
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,566
that's gonna be like

575
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:17,666
really disregulated

576
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,333
but even small shit like a cup of coffee or

577
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,566
you know going on a jog like

578
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,566
it's gonna impact your decision making even

579
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,333
just in a minor way

580
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,500
summer door closed for the winter

581
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,666
maybe we will get a chance to sing on that later

582
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:48,333
you should totally sink karaoke here

583
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,666
the first chance you get

584
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,966
your emotions need to be expressed

585
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,933
people need to know your vast oceanic soul

586
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:58,500
okay this is getting weird this game is like

587
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,966
this is like reading my mind

588
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,100
my soul is puny

589
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:08,166
my soul's cubic content is obscured by the hangover

590
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,066
of course

591
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,066
at this point

592
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,600
precise measurements of your soul

593
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
can only be performed from the outside

594
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,499
it needs to be heard 

595
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:20,196
through a PA system

596
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,900
by other people whether they like it or not

597
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,533
says your adrenaline gland

598
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,066
violently express yourself

599
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:35,666
you have not stumbled on the right lamentation

600
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:37,066
but it's out there

601
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:38,766
it will come to you

602
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,333
you will wreak havoc with it don't worry

603
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:45,800
they'll really get a gauge of my soul with that

604
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,266
serves them rights

605
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,133
wipe that smirk off their face with your sad tragic song 

606
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:53,333
yeah give fuck

607
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,066
I'll show you my cubic content

608
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,300
you have to find something tragic to sing first though

609
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,666
this is my quest now what is this game

610
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:04,466
great

611
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:07,400
I just saw I need some cigarettes and I need a way to

612
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:12,500
blast my miserable soul to as many people and 

613
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,933
solicit it to their unwanting ears

614
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,466
water cooler

615
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:23,766
what is this

616
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:25,600
healing item

617
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,366
where do I find my healing items

618
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,866
is coffee a healing item

619
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:36,800
that's

620
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:38,866
too real in my life

621
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:41,600
don't know where it went

622
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,566
let's talk to this gentleman

623
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,800
a man in his late 20s stands behind the counter

624
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,466
inspecting a stuffed seabird

625
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,966
as you approach he gives you a sideways glance

626
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,533
then looks down again

627
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,366
that was distain in his eyes

628
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,966
even now he's purposely ignoring you

629
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:08,333
interesting I like that the

630
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,766
coding of empathy here is not

631
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,700
like what we commonly think about it as

632
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,500
which is like

633
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,900
relating to someone in an emotional way

634
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,333
empathy is just your ability to read other people's

635
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:23,300
emotions including negative ones like distain

636
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:28,133
let's look at the stuffed bird let's go scope on that

637
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:30,266
a competent work of taxidermy

638
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,200
the white and brown seabird

639
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,400
lies among piles of coasters

640
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,933
and drying mugs

641
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,733
one of its wings broken

642
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,133
the man is trying to mend it

643
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,066
looks like the bird was ripped off the shield

644
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:45,000
that was used to mount it

645
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,666
most likely on a wall

646
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,266
something about it makes you feel bitter

647
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:53,966
what happened to the bird

648
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:56,000
your body is over there

649
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,000
man in the bomberjack is tapping his foot on the floor

650
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,900
why don't you go and talk to him

651
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,533
okay

652
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:04,800
I don't like this deflection

653
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,300
I want to know what happened to the bird

654
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,333
I'm a cop I talk to whoever I please

655
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,166
he pretends not to hear you

656
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,866
concentrating on the bird instead

657
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,200
let's redirect

658
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,366
no I'm not the bartender I'm the cafeteria manager

659
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,533
I'll let him think he's in charge of this exchange

660
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,966
oh no you're a hero a real hero cop

661
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,800
so I'm not only a cop I'm also a hero

662
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,300
I'm gonna feign ignorance to his sarcastic wit

663
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,712
yes you are a real decorated hero

664
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,101
 what did you not do

665
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,000
first you took the body down then you solved the murder

666
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,666
then you didn't trash my hostel room

667
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,600
maybe you even negotiated the strike

668
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,800
guessing I didn't do any of those things

669
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,500
I'm not going to confirm or deny whether I know that

670
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,733
so I'm just going to go with

671
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,933
again a redirection no

672
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:11,800
it's not

673
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:17,300
he raises his shoulders like about to say something

674
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,100
you're right

675
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:19,066
it's not

676
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,466
he has no respect for you person

677
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:25,366
this man sees himself as a law abiden citizen

678
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,533
and for you a representative of that law

679
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,566
he tries to avoid outright conflict

680
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,800
I feel like we won that exchange

681
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:36,100
I feel like that was a victory

682
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:37,866
in my book

683
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:40,866
Monday all right

684
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:42,966
who's the who's the gentleman in the bomber jacket

685
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,733
well let's get a scope on this wheelchair lady first

686
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,066
cryptozoologist

687
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,133
you shouldn't keep your colleague waiting

688
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,500
okay she's got a there's a mystery in her voice

689
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,566
a bespectacled man in an orange bomber jacket

690
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:01,666
is tapping his foot on the floor

691
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,300
as you approach

692
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:07,166
he narrows his eyes and extends his hand in greeting

693
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,933
if an assault were launched on this building right now

694
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,900
if the windows came crashing down

695
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,366
and the whole world descended upon you

696
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:19,533
this man would hurl himself in death's way to save you

697
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,266
you are sure of this but why

698
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:25,733
to be honest

699
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
the why doesn't matter

700
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,100
let's shake this man's hand hello

701
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:30,966
I'm Kim Kitsuragi

702
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,266
lieutenant precinct 57

703
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,566
you must be from the 41st

704
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,533
you realize he's waiting for your name

705
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,700
this is your chance to come up with a really good name

706
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,533
for yourself get creative

707
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,366
conceptualize

708
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,133
all right

709
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,966
Raphael Ambrosius Costeau

710
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:55,933
I was going to get creative

711
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,500
well it's a pretty cool name

712
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,300
want to come up as a douche if I call myself that

713
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,333
no it's very very cool

714
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,666
but maybe just a bit too ostentatious

715
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,866
I'm gonna go with the double superlatives

716
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,500
it's very very cool

717
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:19,933
no it's not Rafael Ambrosius Costeau is one classy name

718
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:22,174
for one classic cop say it

719
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:24,400
I don't know why the game treats this

720
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,566
obvious win as a fail

721
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:27,466
it's a good observation

722
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,300
this is a complete W for me

723
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,666
yes well

724
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,966
he doesn't even process what you just said

725
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,692
it looks like we had a little scheduling error on Sunday 

726
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:39,600
Saturday too actually

727
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:42,400
have you had time to talk to the manager here

728
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,800
there must be some kind of misunderstanding

729
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,266
you're taking me for someone else

730
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:48,466
yeah

731
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:50,366
if you don't mind we should talk to him again

732
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,733
ask him for a rundown of the area

733
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,400
now that I'm here as well

734
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,566
I understand the scene is out back right

735
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:58,300
it also wouldn't hurt to assure him

736
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,800
the police are finally here

737
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,428
in full force I mean 

738
00:36:01,764 --> 00:36:04,000
have you mapped out the initial interviews

739
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
um

740
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,533
I haven't

741
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,333
okay we'll have time for that

742
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,533
after we take a look at the coroner's case

743
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,200
a little bit of honesty goes a long way

744
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I could sense it when I shook this man's hand

745
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,933
and I and I detected that he would give his life for me

746
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:22,000
that he's someone I should be honest with

747
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,200
all of the time

748
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:24,166
except for that time

749
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,300
I just tried to lie to him and make up a cool name

750
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:29,533
but ultimately the game made up a cooler name for me

751
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:30,200
anyways

752
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,600
have you removed the dead body from the tree

753
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,400
I'm just gonna go with him

754
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,666
so the body is still in the tree

755
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,766
it's the first time you detect a weariness in the lieutenant's voice 

756
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:47,266
it's obvious

757
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:50,766
he would have preferred for the body to no longer be in the tree 

758
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:53,000
and a stooped Observation Rafael

759
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,733
where it has been hanging for seven days straight

760
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,333
we should go there as soon as we are done talking to the owner

761
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,700
I can't remember anything

762
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:03,800
what were we supposed to do again

763
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,166
let's let's clarify this point

764
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:08,766
where do we just go with it

765
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,666
no that would be dishonest

766
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,966
I can't tell if I want to be honest

767
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:15,200
then we go out back and take the body down

768
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,066
all right

769
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:17,366
to you officer

770
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:21,533
if you're about to embark on an investigation

771
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,200
shouldn't you have a badge

772
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,500
well I should have a badge and some cigarettes probably

773
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,266
you mean you don't have a badge

774
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,600
losing your identification card is a serious matter

775
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:36,933
my vehicle has a shortwave

776
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:39,400
you can use it to report your badge missing

777
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:42,866
I advise you to try to locate it as quickly as possible

778
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,166
but getting the body down should still take precedence

779
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:49,166
lieutenant Kitsuragi is now in your party

780
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,966
you can talk to him whenever

781
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,566
by interacting with him

782
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:56,166
okay well I've made a new friend at least

783
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,933
hey besage shmack

784
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,766
thank you so much for subbing with prime my friend um

785
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,200
you also get access to all of the stuff in the 

786
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:11,133
Eurobrady archive through doing so

787
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:13,566
you just have to link your Twitch with

788
00:38:13,566 --> 00:38:16,300
discord and you'll get access to that discord channel

789
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,266
and you'll find all of these streams

790
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,533
much earlier there and

791
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,066
a bunch of like

792
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,500
reaction stuff without any of the editing

793
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:27,466
so thank you

794
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:29,400
oh you already have

795
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:32,666
perfect well for anyone watching who does

796
00:38:32,866 --> 00:38:35,166
so that's what you got

797
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,366
it's a little easier when people sub through Patreon because 

798
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,966
there's some instructions but

799
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:44,666
I haven't figured out a good way to

800
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:47,900
inform people who might sub on Twitch

801
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,000
maybe I should just put something in the

802
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,466
about section or whatever

803
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,200
okay I'm not an union member

804
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:01,266
are there any siggy buds lying around 

805
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,500
maybe

806
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,533
this guy's got some cigarettes

807
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:08,600
I could use me as smoke

808
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,933
a man is sleeping

809
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,966
I just watched the lighthouse by the way

810
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,933
if you guys have seen that

811
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,866
maybe we'll talk about the lighthouse at some point

812
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:19,200
but he says that I could use me a smoke

813
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,671
A man is sleeping at the table

814
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:23,500
wearing mud-caked boots and rolled down overalls

815
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,933
the back of his shirt reads

816
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:26,500
Wild Pines

817
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:28,233
encircled by a logo with a tree

818
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,966
 on the counter rolled out of his open hand

819
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:34,133
you see a blister pack of headache medicine

820
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,900
I'm gonna take those pills

821
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,866
the man does not mind you probably need them more than he does

822
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:43,933
you've just picked up some magnesium

823
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:47,100
this item is stored in the bottom left corner of the screen 

824
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,166
above your character portrait

825
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:51,533
use magnesium to heal your morale

826
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,166
if you have morale damage

827
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,900
morale damage okay

828
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,333
no idea

829
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,566
looks like he works for Wild Lions

830
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,200
the logistics company who owns and operates the harbour

831
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,800
possibly because there's a strike going on in the harbour

832
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,866
there's not much to do aside from drinking and sleeping

833
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,866
let's try to wake him up

834
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:17,333
you gently shake his shoulder

835
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,766
I have failed everything I've tried

836
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:21,166
this man could probably

837
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,900
sleep soundly in a ship's engine room

838
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
whatever they don't fucking care about him anyways

839
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,100
okay

840
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,933
I had to talk to the manager again right

841
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:40,400
the man with unimpressive beard notices you approaching

842
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,766
he dropped the ledger he was holding

843
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:44,700
and turns to the lieutenant

844
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,066
I love how the addiction focused therapist wants to get addicted 

845
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:50,700
look I'm trying to push this guy to his limits

846
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,166
and I want to demonstrate

847
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:58,000
look all I'm trying to do is give a public service announcement 

848
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,600
okay drugs are bad for you

849
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,166
and they will do bad things to you

850
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,533
and you will do bad things to yourself and other people

851
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:05,500
when you're on them

852
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:10,300
so what better way to illustrate than that to

853
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,600
get my boy here on

854
00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:14,900
the sigs

855
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,566
Mr Garte right

856
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:21,466
yes

857
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,366
I am Kim Kitsuragi from precinct 57

858
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,966
this is an interdistrict investigation

859
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:30,000
so joining me from precinct 41

860
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,700
he looks to you

861
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,366
realizing he still doesn't know your name

862
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,933
Raphael Ambrosia Casto

863
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:41,533
right now I know it took us a while to arrive at the scene  

864
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,800
it also took a while to colors and reported dead body

865
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,866
it was you who plays the call yes

866
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,366
correct no I only just got here

867
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:52,666
it was probably Sylvie who called you

868
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,466
she usually works the bar here

869
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:57,466
I'm only temporarily taking over her duties

870
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,712
you're probably wandering in some

871
00:41:59,712 --> 00:42:01,800
Grove of tag elders up north in candi

872
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,766
knee deep in snow

873
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:04,900
black Marvel with the lighthouse quote

874
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,197
fucking love that movie

875
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,566
not a coincidental parallel to make

876
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,266
he's got the dead seabird here

877
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,466
we're talking about stuff that has really good

878
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:21,800
pros prosaic dialogue and writing

879
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,766
and is about the inner misery of human experience

880
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,900
do you have our number

881
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,100
and the desperate clinging for

882
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:32,539
release

883
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:35,000
top 5 for sure yeah definitely

884
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,966
as a matter of fact I do

885
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,966
you said you just got here from where

886
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:43,900
what of Martinaise

887
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:46,200
no I live in Jamrock

888
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:49,166
I only sometimes come here to keep an eye on the place

889
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,133
this is just one of the many many cafeterias I manage

890
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,933
oh he's a multi hyphenet he's an enterprising man

891
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:57,600
but you still know your way around

892
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:00,466
yes in case we need directions

893
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,933
yes I know where some things are

894
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:05,400
but as I said I don't live here

895
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,400
I just used to work here

896
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:09,400
and I'm not going to start working here again

897
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,533
if that's what you think

898
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,766
I didn't imply that detective

899
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,600
I have everything you

900
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,600
no I'm

901
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,800
yes yes

902
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,066
he means do you have questions for me

903
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:26,900
like a police officer would

904
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,066
where exactly why we know the bodies in the tree

905
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,900
who killed I don't know who killed him

906
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,133
I'm not the police

907
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:37,366
that's your job

908
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:38,400
did you kill him

909
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,666
crazy of course I didn't kill him

910
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:42,500
I don't know you're looking

911
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,000
you're getting pretty frustrated

912
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,900
with that suddenly tense up

913
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:48,566
blood is being pushed to your muscles

914
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,566
you should hound him on this

915
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,100
hound him hard

916
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:52,733
yeah

917
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:53,933
fucking go for it

918
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,866
no I didn't I didn't

919
00:43:57,866 --> 00:44:00,166
I don't appreciate this what is this

920
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,966
do I have to answer him

921
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,600
is this mandatory

922
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,366
it's the law

923
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:08,066
lieutenant stands motionless

924
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:10,466
his expression unreadable

925
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,900
what are you an idiot

926
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,733
I told you I haven't killed anyone

927
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,400
anyone have you killed someone else

928
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,800
then she ignores you

929
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,100
she went away because none of your business

930
00:44:24,821 --> 00:44:27,666
okay find this building there's a courtyard

931
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,766
they hoisted him up on a tree there

932
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,866
that's easy see that door there

933
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,766
first you exit through that

934
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,000
then to your right

935
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,133
you should see a big hole in the fence

936
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,666
a really big one

937
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,000
you can get to the courtyard through there

938
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,466
no need for the keys

939
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:44,500
the hole is big

940
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,300
enough for the Franconigerian cavalry to fit through

941
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,566
does he want you to feel guilty of making that hole

942
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,800
it's implied in his voice

943
00:44:53,366 --> 00:44:54,466
let's go

944
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,966
so I'm the hole-maker

945
00:44:56,966 --> 00:45:00,400
not so fast you owe me 130 real

946
00:45:03,466 --> 00:45:07,533
Savoir Faire I think it means to make a save in French

947
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:08,800
fair as like to do

948
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,600
and savoir save

949
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:17,200
pretty low chance

950
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:24,600
I slip away unnoticed I mean look 17 percent

951
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:29,533
that's good enough odds for me

952
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:30,600
I'm not a mathematician

953
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,933
but I think I've got a pretty good chance at slipping away 

954
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:38,733
as you blow this joint

955
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:39,933
what the fuck

956
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,900
I completely worked

957
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,700
let's fucking go

958
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,333
let's blow this fucking joint

959
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:53,400
real mature man real mature

960
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:56,966
alright Raphael

961
00:45:57,066 --> 00:45:59,400
let's fucking go what a start to our adventure

962
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,766
ah savoir means to know

963
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:09,700
sevoir fair is when you know how to do a know how

964
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,024
gotcha thank you for the clarification 

965
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:13,966
I'm still a beginner

966
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,733
un débutant in French

967
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,166
let's fucking go that was

968
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,866
a great start to our adventure

969
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,766
okay we're looking for a fence

970
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,700
let's get a scope on that trash can first

971
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,000
bottles inside you should pick them up if you had a bag

972
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:38,566
are they empty bottles

973
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:43,933
look I know that my character is actually looking for

974
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,533
some tasty sigs so

975
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:53,533
is there like an information kiosk or something

976
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,666
this poste L'Aventurier

977
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:58,933
mail collection box has been heavily vandalized

978
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:00,100
with graffito

979
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:01,700
a closer inspection

980
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,333
reveals two bullet holes in the front

981
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,300
give the delivery box a pat

982
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:09,133
let's do it

983
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:10,600
I'm

984
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,500
gonna give more humanity to the delivery box than most

985
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,500
people in this place

986
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
seems happy

987
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:19,166
what the fuck is this interaction I love this

988
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:22,533
hey no worries Bionic ghost thanks for stepping by

989
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,200
some of the best moments

990
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,400
of the game come from failing checks

991
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,166
so don't be discouraged by

992
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,866
odds if you really want to do something

993
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:30,700
oh totally

994
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:34,466
each shit pig fucked by the CUNN

995
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,133
and saint G with the crown have been scribbled on it

996
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,133
Jenny is a whore and baise cette mailbox also

997
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,600
I feel you male collection box

998
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:53,384
the male collection box seemed cathartic thankfully even

999
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:54,533
so do you

1000
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:57,166
you shudder then you swallow

1001
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,200
this was a very human

1002
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,900
exchange

1003
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,100
and then suddenly you see it

1004
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:06,333
over all the other graffitas

1005
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,966
someone has using the tip of a very sharp knife

1006
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,766
cut the words revachol forever

1007
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,600
all right

1008
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:19,400
I couldn't get the tie so the mailbox is my best friend

1009
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:26,966
so apparently I

1010
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,166
maybe I do need to go look in the mirror

1011
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,700
I want to see what happens if I don't

1012
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,100
before he stands a motorcarriage

1013
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:42,166
the bodywork is covered in blue and white livery

1014
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:44,466
bearing the number 57

1015
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:46,700
vapor emanates from the large

1016
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,600
engine on the back of the vehicle

1017
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:50,933
it hasn't had time to cool off yet

1018
00:48:51,366 --> 00:48:52,566
in the cabin

1019
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:54,766
you are welcomed by a set of steering levers

1020
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,800
a radio microphone on a hook

1021
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,066
a pull out toolbox under the seat

1022
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:02,700
and the soft glow of the fuel preheater gauge

1023
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:10,933
let's get Kim's opinion here

1024
00:49:10,933 --> 00:49:12,366
this is the Coupris Kineema

1025
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:13,800
my motor carriage

1026
00:49:13,966 --> 00:49:16,366
you can use the toolbox and the radio if you'd like

1027
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,333
motor carriage motor carriage

1028
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,700
something bad with a motor carriage

1029
00:49:24,266 --> 00:49:26,733
a dark lump rises in your throat

1030
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:29,900
okay but what is a motor carriage

1031
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
do all the policemen in

1032
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,000
RCM have such cool motor carriages

1033
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,066
the Coupris MotorCorp does provide

1034
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:38,366
most of our petrol vehicles yes

1035
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:48,266
in the cabin you see a set of steering levers

1036
00:49:48,266 --> 00:49:51,466
a metallic drawer slides out from under the seat

1037
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,066
and clicks into place

1038
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,900
take what you need officer

1039
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,966
it's going to be a long case

1040
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,333
I'm not protective of my tools like some men are

1041
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,933
Tim is a good guy

1042
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:03,933
he's clearly a little protective of his tools

1043
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,333
but what can he do

1044
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,300
work is work 

1045
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,733
I'm thinking chain cutters

1046
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:12,600
handles are long and sleek

1047
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:15,866
snap snap though the cutters in your hand

1048
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:17,666
probably gonna need to do some more work on

1049
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:18,800
that fence over there

1050
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:20,466
let's go with the flashlight

1051
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,866
robust weatherproof and well made

1052
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,000
police issue blue

1053
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,866
lets you see things in the dark you would otherwise miss 

1054
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:30,766
let's take the pry bar

1055
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:32,733
probably need to defend myself your hand

1056
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,566
heavier than you'd think

1057
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,066
yeah I'm really enjoying the mix of French

1058
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:41,200
did he say it was like Franco-Nigerian

1059
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,000
is that is this a like a

1060
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,733
is that a setting

1061
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:47,666
cold and heavy

1062
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,017
like truth

1063
00:50:50,017 --> 00:50:53,533
you feel like you're reunited with truth once more

1064
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,866
useful for opening all sorts of doors and lids

1065
00:50:56,866 --> 00:51:00,066
the pullout toolbox slides back into its nest

1066
00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:03,300
preheater gate casts the warm glow on the steering levers 

1067
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,130
and the radio on its hook

1068
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,466
the frequency tabler lights up

1069
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:10,133
and the green button labeled Prime Line

1070
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:12,366
glows like a feline eye

1071
00:51:12,566 --> 00:51:14,733
and then you hear something

1072
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,666
damn the writing is so good I

1073
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,000
feel all the sensation of that

1074
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,533
like a feline eye

1075
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,400
love it

1076
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:27,566
it's not a real world

1077
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:28,533
it's a fictional universe

1078
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:30,566
but you'll learn more history okay

1079
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:33,600
the soft purr of electrical kittens

1080
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:37,566
radio waves cast farm electrical kittens

1081
00:51:37,866 --> 00:51:39,600
what a Turner phrase you

1082
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:40,933
through the static

1083
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,466
this is precinct 57

1084
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,766
hello lieutenant how may I assist you

1085
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,933

1087
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,666

00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:05,200
this is officer Alice DeMettrie Precinct 57

1091
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,600
how may I assist you

1092
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:09,966
could you connect me to the 41st precinct

1093
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,466
of course what is her number officer

1094
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,400
did he get sylvie's number

1095
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:22,000
her number is 005

1096
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,565
received hold on officer

1097
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:30,666
lieutenant kitsuragi

1098
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:32,800
slowly begins to tap a little rhythm

1099
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,466
with his right foot

1100
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,300
officer I have sylvie malaiika on the line for you

1101
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,166
yes hello

1102
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:42,566
there she is

1103
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,866
okay this is the police calling

1104
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:46,266
I have some questions for you about

1105
00:52:46,266 --> 00:52:47,133
your last days at work

1106
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:48,966
Sylvie I believe we've met before this is me

1107
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,300
let's not reveal our identity

1108
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,100
all right

1109
00:52:53,933 --> 00:52:54,733
hello officer

1110
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:55,933
what can I do for you

1111
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,266
you can hear resentment in her tone

1112
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:00,900
she's not thrilled to be talking to you again

1113
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:04,133
there is no resentment in her tone

1114
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,700
she wants you to ask her out

1115
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,133
oh man

1116
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:08,933
no question about it

1117
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:11,400
electrochemistry is

1118
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,533
he's got an interesting view on the world

1119
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,866
my dude's body

1120
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:21,100
demands it

1121
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,800
we already missed our chance with the

1122
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,766
girl with the cigarette so

1123
00:53:25,866 --> 00:53:26,666
I don't know

1124
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,800
conflicting thoughts yeah

1125
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:32,933
do you want a cup of coffee

1126
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:35,266
no I think that would be in poor taste

1127
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:37,366
yeah I'm gonna try to

1128
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:39,800
quell my urges

1129
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,133
you mean why did I leave the bar

1130
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,700
honestly I'm

1131
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,166
not really comfortable discussing it with you sir

1132
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,166
why aren't you comfortable discussing it with me

1133
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,066
let's just say I left

1134
00:53:58,066 --> 00:54:00,266
because I needed to get away from someone

1135
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,388
I won't push you on this no that doesn't sound like our guy

1136
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:04,228
 you know who 

1137
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,800
you think you hear a sliver of accusation in her words

1138
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,566
is it me

1139
00:54:08,566 --> 00:54:12,300
don't be paranoid she's obviously talking about someone else

1140
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,166
what the fuck

1141
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,800
this game is in my brain

1142
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:18,766
is it me

1143
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:21,166
I really don't want to talk about this

1144
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,400
let's just forget about this okay

1145
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:25,766
maybe I don't know

1146
00:54:27,366 --> 00:54:30,133
I just know I have to take some time off right now

1147
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,200
okay you are not helping me

1148
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:34,800
please don't call me again bye

1149
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:39,400
let's try out some empathy

1150
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:42,166
yes you have obviously done something to upset her

1151
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,100
at the whirling in rags

1152
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,800
when she was still working there

1153
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,800
you're mad at me right tell me what did I do

1154
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,066
I'm not mad it's just

1155
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:55,366
you were so drunk and so emotional all the time

1156
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:56,133
and then

1157
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:57,766
the skua thing thing happened

1158
00:54:58,766 --> 00:55:00,400
this made me want to quit

1159
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,333
I was the one who made you want to quit

1160
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,733
yes obviously

1161
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,266
you were the worst client I've ever seen

1162
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:08,500
and I have seen so many assholes in here

1163
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,600
okay we're learning a little bit about ourselves here

1164
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,166
I've had sailors fighting

1165
00:55:12,266 --> 00:55:15,466
union guys grabbing my ass kids stealing booze

1166
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:19,034
once a guy was glued to the karaoke machine every night 

1167
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:20,000
for two months

1168
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,100
but you

1169
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:23,000
what did I do

1170
00:55:23,366 --> 00:55:24,900
you were worse than all of them

1171
00:55:25,133 --> 00:55:27,866
honestly you were getting boarded line aggressive

1172
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,620
even about little things 

1173
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,167
like not turning down the volume at 3 am

1174
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:34,466
I even liked one of those songs 

1175
00:55:34,466 --> 00:55:36,166
you kept listening to on repeat

1176
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,566
no more I I hate it now

1177
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:39,766
okay

1178
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,266
which song

1179
00:55:42,266 --> 00:55:44,133
we go on by the OO

1180
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,733
I can't listen to it anymore

1181
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:48,266
you've turned it into a parody

1182
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:49,266
that's the song I'm gonna

1183
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:50,900
sing later at the karaoke bar

1184
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,366
then there was your room

1185
00:55:54,866 --> 00:55:56,200
your project 

1186
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,200
I tried to send the cleaner but you wouldn't let me

1187
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,733
threatened to makes me understand

1188
00:56:01,866 --> 00:56:03,966
oh no I have no idea what you meant

1189
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:05,566
and I don't want to know

1190
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,900
 and then you screamded something incomprehensible

1191
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,100
about churches and the scent of apricots and aquariums

1192
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,533
oh my God

1193
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,266
that's not so bad

1194
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,366
I'm sorry let's apologize again

1195
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:20,200
I had to deal with your toilet

1196
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:20,800
the one you

1197
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,486
clogged with police documents

1198
00:56:22,486 --> 00:56:25,000
causing water damage downstairs in the kitchen

1199
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,600
I won't even mention you waving your gun around

1200
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,933
harassing customers

1201
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:31,100
threatening to sing karaoke

1202
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:33,000
threatening to kill yourself

1203
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,733
wait police documents okay

1204
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:36,133
we're actually getting somewhere here

1205
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,600
the ones I had to rent out of your toilet

1206
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,466
they're in the toilet

1207
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,366
damn it I don't remember what I did to your damn papers

1208
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:47,066
I don't remember every little thing I do

1209
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,766
she's worried she might have accidentally done

1210
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:51,066
something bad

1211
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,866
then she remembers it's you

1212
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,366
especially when there's a hurricane loose

1213
00:56:56,366 --> 00:56:59,533
it's your fault for losing them not mine

1214
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,766
something in you wants to immediately forget about this

1215
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:05,000
as if there was a reason you threw them away

1216
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,700
no you really weren't

1217
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,600
you were simply the worst

1218
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:14,800
well you're the worst tavern wench I've ever seen Geez

1219
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,300
don't you ever party

1220
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:21,400
okay if I'm imagining

1221
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,133
my guy at this point like

1222
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,566
he's having these conflicting desires

1223
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:28,266
and at one moment you

1224
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:30,500
you do see people especially who are

1225
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,466
let's say hungover or withdrawing or detoxing like

1226
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:37,000
their emotional

1227
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,533
mood can shift very drastically right and

1228
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:42,666
while I have been pursuing a very

1229
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,500
empathetic response here

1230
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,466
my priority as a character is like finding out

1231
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:49,800
more information and

1232
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,066
she has reached her limit

1233
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:52,466
she's not telling me anything new

1234
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,966
so she's useless to me now

1235
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,733
from my character's point of view

1236
00:57:58,733 --> 00:58:01,500
god I know I shouldn't have brought it up

1237
00:58:01,566 --> 00:58:03,366
just try not to call me again

1238
00:58:03,366 --> 00:58:05,733
and let's pretend it never happened

1239
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:12,131
the stuffed bird the great skua 

1240
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:13,700
you threw it against the walls

1241
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,733
fuck that bird

1242
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:18,066
fuck that bird and I think you said it had been

1243
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:20,566
giving you shit ever since you got there

1244
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:26,333
bitch bird got what's coming to her

1245
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,533
this doesn't sound anything like me I love birds

1246
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,700
right

1247
00:58:35,733 --> 00:58:40,766

1248
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:42,133

1249
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:43,566
sad

1250
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,600
I think the one you mean is the smallest church  in Saint saens

1251
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,300
butchered that right up

1252
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:52,733
interesting you still have to find it however

1253
00:58:52,933 --> 00:58:55,200

1259
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,466
smoking with a large white rectangle sewn on his vest

1260
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:19,533
in front of him is a box shaped apparatus

1261
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:22,500
with an array of wires and antennas

1262
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,400
the radio switchboard

1263

01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:24,123

1287
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:26,166

1300
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,533

1318
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:38,000
to be honest though I don't think I should have a gun

1319
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:39,566

1320

17 percent chance that did not steer me wrong last time

1324
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:52,400
let's go for it

1325
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:54,933
even before you can get the words out

1326
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:57,533
everything gets scrambled in your brain

1327
01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:00,800
oh it's not like

1328
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,500
I tried to convince them and they don't believe me

1329
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,200
I literally couldn't say it

1330
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,600
he says he didn't lose his gun

1331
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,200
or his fun whatever that means

1332
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:11,766
ask him to describe

1333
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,766
it his gun not as fun

1334
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:15,166
oh fuck these people

1335
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:17,333
I want to be out of this conversation now

1336
01:02:18,266 --> 01:02:20,200
the fuck do you need a gun for

1337
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:22,927
look at the pythons on your arms

1338
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:24,266
you are a gun

1339
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:24,933
let's go

1340
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:26,600
the biggest one in the world

1341
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:27,000
yeah

1342
01:02:27,542 --> 01:02:29,800
oh request a description huh

1343
01:02:30,133 --> 01:02:31,266
we'll give him one

1344
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:33,133
describe the Blaasma Gun

1345
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:35,733
for starters it's massive

1346
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,600
got flared cooling vents along the front and 

1347
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,666
hydrogen flasks sticking out too

1348
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:43,266
a regular goddamn murder weapon

1349
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:46,133
you know how they are bang bang that sounds like me

1350
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:47,900
he says it's just a regular gun

1351
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,166
sounds like he's being deliberately vague

1352
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:53,533
this scene is great what the fuck is happening

1353
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:55,466
Detective Mullen has done it again

1354
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:56,866
uhhh

1355
01:02:57,133 --> 01:02:59,100
where's my gun now

1356
01:02:59,100 --> 01:02:59,933
fuck off

1357
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:01,866
dear God he locks his gun

1358
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,000
oh my I can't

1359
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,166
I hope I get revenge on these people later

1360
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,000
this isn't really a laughing matter

1361
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,700
Mack can faced the giant of koko nur by himself

1362
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,500
but disco here made him piss his pants

1363
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,600
oh I can't fuck he lost his

1364
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:22,000
ask him if he still has his wiener

1365
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,066
I'm not going to

1366
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:24,900
ask him

1367
01:03:26,966 --> 01:03:29,300
sergant torson here is wondering if you are still

1368
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,166
in possession of your genitalia over

1369
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:36,936
now is a good time to say fuck and ass and so on 

1370
01:03:36,936 --> 01:03:38,966
that'll make this all right

1371
01:03:40,766 --> 01:03:42,300
yeah I'm just gonna turn the radio off

1372
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,733
I'm feeling too ashamed to continue this

1373
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:45,599
the slience is almost deafening

1374
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,533
after you flick off the switch

1375
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:48,933
severing the connection

1376
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,333
that did not go well

1377
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,026
I guess the important thing is that

1378
01:03:52,026 --> 01:03:55,100
 you followed protocol and reported your lost items 

1379
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,866
that's a great

1380
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,066
positive reframing

1381
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:01,533
did we need anything else here

1382
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,533
oh no I don't think we need anything else

1383
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:07,933
let's just keep going

1384
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,000
I'll count that as a win

1385
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,933
I do count that as a win I did the right thing

1386
01:04:11,966 --> 01:04:14,000
okay let's see what we got here we've got a

1387
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,133

1388
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:17,866

01:04:18,566 --> 01:04:20,800
oh that's that's cool

1390
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,366
probably don't need to be holding that though

1391
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,500
I am gonna hold the crowbar though you never know

1392
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:36,866

the boy is sweating profusely

1405
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,066
his eyes are like two black holes and his jaw is

1406
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:22,333
twitching as if trying to break free from the

1407
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:23,933
empire of his body

1408
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:25,700
okay so he's on drugs

1409
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:32,100

does Cuno know what a rake is

1426
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,900

how we got there and the usual

1450

do you know how he got up

1458
01:07:18,999 --> 01:07:22,400

1459
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:23,800

1460
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:25,966
Cuno wasn't even in Martinaise

1461
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,566
Cuno wasn't in Revachol

1462
01:07:27,766 --> 01:07:29,133
Cuno wasn't regional

1463
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,800
I don't know some fucking

1464

Night City Cuno is in fucking Night City

1466
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:43,500
Cuno gives this info out on a need to know basis

1467
01:07:43,533 --> 01:07:45,566
and you don't need to know

1468
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:49,966
Cuno didn't smoke the gimp if that's what you meant

1469
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:50,266
yeah

1470
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,266
Cuno is smoking something though 

1471
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,900
right you're testing Cuno's patience here

1472
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:57,200
I'm done with you Cuno

1473
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,966

1474
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:08,500

1478
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,566
there are several footprints in the mud

1479
01:08:17,766 --> 01:08:19,266

1483
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,266
he can't even count the number of shoes really

1484
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:36,600
let's try

1485
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,133

1486
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,500
all right

1487
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:41,333

1488
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,166

1 standard work boot steel reinforced toes number 46

1490
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:56,766
I'll take it okay so 8 pairs of footprints this was a

1491
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,500
this was a multi man crime

1492
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,933
literally streamer luck

1493
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,533
sometimes your chances increase if you

1494
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:08,933
explore other dialogue first okay

1495
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:15,333
2 standard work boot steel reinforced toes no 44

1496
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:18,933
my yeah my guys like absolutely falling apart

1497
01:09:18,933 --> 01:09:20,400
except when it comes to like

1498
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,566
really weird stuff

1499
01:09:23,966 --> 01:09:25,766
he's just extremely perceptive

1500
01:09:25,766 --> 01:09:29,072
...steel reinforced toes no 43

1501
01:09:29,437 --> 01:09:35,066
4 standard work boot no 45 or 46

1502
01:09:35,466 --> 01:09:41,733
5 another standard work boot steel reinforced toes no 44

1503
01:09:41,766 --> 01:09:44,766
oh they can they can decrease as well okay

1504
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,300
six an aberration

1505
01:09:47,566 --> 01:09:50,133
light as air even pace

1506
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,465
same make of boot but number 41 

1507
01:09:53,465 --> 01:09:54,135
male or female

1508
01:09:54,135 --> 01:09:55,105
impossible to tell

1509
01:09:55,966 --> 01:09:57,766
could also have been an adolescent

1510
01:09:58,166 --> 01:09:59,455
the gait is undeveloped

1511
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:02,166
Cuno could be involved

1512
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:03,266
I'm pretty good at this ain't I yeah

1513
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:04,533
you're not bad

1514
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,066
it's as if the whole world darkens

1515
01:10:07,266 --> 01:10:10,800
everything else has a thin film of unimportance on it

1516
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:13,300
and the tracks burn in the middle of it

1517
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:14,976
in a strange beautiful way

1518
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,100
7）the glowing...

1519
01:10:16,266 --> 01:10:17,900
I wonder if Kim thinks of my

1520
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,900
because Kim

1521
01:10:19,933 --> 01:10:24,066
26 but the imprints are twice as deep as the others

1522
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,100
the weight exceeds 200 kg

1523
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:29,133
I get the vibe that Kim

1524
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,066
thinks I'm very unimpressive

1525
01:10:31,066 --> 01:10:32,466
and that he just has to spend time

1526
01:10:32,466 --> 01:10:33,800
with me because of the duty

1527
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,766
but I wonder what he thinks about my astute

1528
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:37,366
observations now

1529
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:41,300
and yet another standard work boot number 44

1530
01:10:41,733 --> 01:10:44,976
there's an aberration in the pattern of the sole however 

1531
01:10:44,976 --> 01:10:48,666
the right sole is smoother more worn

1532
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:49,866
I'm definitely gonna ask him

1533
01:10:49,866 --> 01:10:51,533
I really want to impress

1534
01:10:51,533 --> 01:10:53,800
him and I want him to think that I'm cool and

1535
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,566
that I'm not a fucking mess

1536
01:10:55,566 --> 01:10:56,366
how many

1537
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,533
what is so great if I just blew it

1538
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,333
if I just did all of that observation and was like

1539
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:10,428
fucking four hundred million

1540
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:12,866
let's go

1541
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,298
there's 8

1542
01:11:14,298 --> 01:11:16,866
I was pretty often I counted 20

1543
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,200
that's why I'm the deputy and you're the lieutenant

1544
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:22,900
way off Kim way off

1545
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,466
yeah clean those glasses Kim

1546
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,766
I never got the hang of it hyperopia

1547
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:30,666
you need me

1548
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,100
do you see anything out of the ordinary

1549
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:35,933
okay wait I actually need to do something else

1550
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:37,166
what did it say

1551
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:41,100
I was more focused on how impressive

1552
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,666
I was doing rather than the

1553
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,566
actual content of what I was seeing

1554
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,800
an aberration one so smoother than the other

1555
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,700
interesting

1556
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:00,100
let's name it the odd sole

1557
01:12:00,266 --> 01:12:01,466
the odd sole

1558
01:12:01,566 --> 01:12:04,466
Kim is you know what he is he's a wordsmith

1559
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,666
he's he's the one who's really providing the

1560
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:08,366
narrative context to our adventures

1561
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:11,066
someone operating work bench with a pedal

1562
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:12,900
like a joiner at the habor

1563
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,600
or maybe a drummer

1564
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,500
he regrets it the moment he says it

1565
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,000
drummer that's stupid

1566
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,366
no we don't want we want him to think we're cool

1567
01:12:21,366 --> 01:12:22,166
we don't want to

1568
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:23,300
I want him

1569
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,100
I want him to feel a little bit inadequate so that he

1570
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,000
feels like

1571
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:29,066
like he needs me in his life

1572
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,800
but I don't want to push him away

1573
01:12:31,933 --> 01:12:33,666
this is a fine line

1574
01:12:35,766 --> 01:12:37,333
I'll just not I'll let him

1575
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:41,600
I'll let that observation simmer in in the air

1576
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,066
I don't know why I say that

1577
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,933
we are not looking for a drummer

1578
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:47,400
we are looking for a group of dockworkers

1579
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,566
why'd you say it then Kim

1580
01:12:48,566 --> 01:12:49,933
what do you know that you're not telling me

1581
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:52,166
the lieutenant clearly appreciates the chance

1582
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:54,800
to clear up the drummer issue himself

1583
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:57,000
perhaps it could be a driver

1584
01:12:57,466 --> 01:13:00,100
a driver would wear out their right shoe before the left 

1585
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,866
the accelerator is on the right

1586
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,300
it's a little suspicious Kim

1587
01:13:05,066 --> 01:13:06,200
who are you protecting

1588
01:13:07,566 --> 01:13:09,200
I just nod thoughtfully

1589
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,000
we should keep our eyes open around the traffic jam

1590
01:13:12,066 --> 01:13:15,166
see whether anyone strikes out as a potential suspect

1591
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,866
seems prudent no

1592
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,166
yes prudent

1593
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:19,766
hmm

1594
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,700
alright I'm a little suspicious of Kim now

1595
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:28,800
a cop doing some manipulation

1596
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,566
like it's not manipulation I'm doing detective

1597
01:13:31,566 --> 01:13:32,700
I'm detecting

1598
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:34,166
impress him more

1599
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:34,766
okay let's go

1600
01:13:34,766 --> 01:13:36,566
a woman or a kid

1601
01:13:40,766 --> 01:13:43,400
light step No. 41 what did I say about that

1602
01:13:48,866 --> 01:13:50,733
oh it actually doesn't go all the way up

1603
01:13:50,733 --> 01:13:51,900
okay that's fine

1604
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,500
I don't think there's any way to be sure

1605
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:00,733
lightstep

1606
01:14:01,133 --> 01:14:02,866
well there's probably not

1607
01:14:02,933 --> 01:14:05,166
oh it could be a kid it's probably fucking Cuno

1608
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:06,800
okay how do you know

1609
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,466
he knows it's hard to discern sex from a person's gait

1610
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Raphael he's a fucking genius

1611
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:24,500
I'm just saying random things

1612
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,700
while looking at holes in the mud

1613
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,600
I have no no I can't be that honest I just do

1614
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,333
understood anything else

1615
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,800
okay Kim that's why I'm the

1616
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,733
I'm the lead detective here

1617
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,298
okay let's go last one heavy one 200 kilogram imprint

1618
01:14:39,298 --> 01:14:39,798
two hundred

1619
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,600
could it be the combined weight of two people

1620
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,700
one carrying the other who's tied up

1621
01:14:44,866 --> 01:14:46,966
let's say a heavily built worker

1622
01:14:46,966 --> 01:14:49,933
carrying a similarly built soon to be dead men

1623
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:54,333
could be the combined weight of two people

1624
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:56,133
one carrying the other who's tied up

1625
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:58,466
what kind of observation is that

1626
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:02,200
he might be right

1627
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:06,333
200 kg of living weight is unlikely

1628
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,000
I'll kilograms yeah that's pretty heavy

1629
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,100
could have been an extremely obese person

1630
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:15,000
one of them was carrying him over

1631
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,533
possibly yes

1632
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,066
how old do you think these tracks are

1633
01:15:20,066 --> 01:15:23,366
...7 days would feed the time frame provided to us by the caller 

1634
01:15:23,366 --> 01:15:24,866
who reported the hanging

1635
01:15:25,466 --> 01:15:27,300
it is not impossible

1636
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:30,200
I pulled last week's forecast for coastal Revachol

1637
01:15:30,366 --> 01:15:32,066
7 days below freezing

1638
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,066
the day before

1639
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:35,766
the day of his hanging was the last one day

1640
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:38,566
okay solid information there

1641
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,533
sub zero temperatures would preserve the

1642
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:41,966
tracks in a good state

1643
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,766
the commotion here could have taken place a week ago

1644
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,533
what do you think happened here Kim

1645
01:15:47,533 --> 01:15:48,400
what do I think

1646
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:51,600
a mob of people brought something heavy to the tree

1647
01:15:51,933 --> 01:15:53,933
one of them was carrying the victim

1648
01:15:54,366 --> 01:15:56,766
they shuffled around especially under the tree

1649
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,400
hmm

1650
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,366
then after hoisting him up

1651
01:16:02,366 --> 01:16:05,066
this stood in a semicircle facing his direction

1652
01:16:05,466 --> 01:16:07,733
at first glance this appears to be a lynching

1653
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:09,566
indeed

1654
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:13,100
they all stood in a row here and looked at the tree

1655
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,333
that's fucked up

1656
01:16:14,866 --> 01:16:17,133
oh some solid detective work there Kim

1657
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,866
okay so

1658
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,866
I wanted to level up

1659
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,700
well let's get a look at this character sheet here

1660
01:16:29,466 --> 01:16:32,600
wield raw intellectual power deduce the world okay

1661
01:16:32,933 --> 01:16:34,600
our intellect is really bad

1662
01:16:36,866 --> 01:16:38,166
our psyche though

1663
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:40,866
to influence ourselves and others

1664
01:16:42,533 --> 01:16:46,366
okay so I'm thinking that we just railroad the PSYCHE

1665
01:16:47,866 --> 01:16:50,133
and just forget everything else

1666
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:53,733
like all I want to do is influence other people

1667
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,066
so that I don't need an intellect

1668
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,566
I'm okay with where my physique is at

1669
01:17:01,566 --> 01:17:03,566
it's just barely enough to move me around

1670
01:17:08,266 --> 01:17:11,466
so I think I'm gonna go with psyche here

1671
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,933
just going off gut feelings

1672
01:17:15,066 --> 01:17:16,466
there's an info button when you have a

1673
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:17,533
skill highlighted

1674
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:21,166
where am I where am I looking at

1675
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:27,166
ah there we go

1676
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,966
Inland Empire is the unfiltered wellspring of imagination 

1677
01:17:30,966 --> 01:17:31,966
emotion and foreboding

1678
01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:34,200
it enables you to grope your way through invisible

1679
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,500
dimensions of reality

1680
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,200
gaining insight into that which

1681
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,400
sight can't see

1682
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,500
what's really going

1683
01:17:40,933 --> 01:17:44,400
what do these enigmatic riddles mean for the world fate

1684
01:17:44,533 --> 01:17:47,366
at high levels Inland Empire animates the inanimate

1685
01:17:47,766 --> 01:17:49,566
you'll have conversations with your clothing

1686
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:50,933
conversations that may change

1687
01:17:50,933 --> 01:17:52,366
the course of the investigation

1688
01:17:52,366 --> 01:17:55,133
if you're not thrown in the looney bin first

1689
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,166
with low inland empire you'll be a void of imagination

1690
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,533
and character

1691
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:03,366
and how will you shape the cosmos

1692
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,533
good distribution though

1693
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:10,800
low logic and calculus is rough

1694
01:18:13,366 --> 01:18:15,066
I do like the visual calculus

1695
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,300
like I want to be able to just scope shit out

1696
01:18:17,566 --> 01:18:18,566
intuitively

1697
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,133
reconstruct crime scenes

1698
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:23,666
follow my gut yeah

1699
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,000
charm men and women play the puppet master I'm pretty

1700
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,533
I almost always I go for charisma

1701
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,900
connect Station 41 no I don't give a shit about that

1702
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,166
intimidate the public assert yourself

1703
01:18:37,866 --> 01:18:39,766
no intimidation

1704
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:43,766
is a little too showy for me I want to be

1705
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:46,700
deceptively convincing

1706
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,333
work your mirror neurons

1707
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:50,133
check that up

1708
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:50,600
empathy

1709
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,900
breaks into the souls of others and forces you to feel

1710
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,766
what's inside

1711
01:18:53,866 --> 01:18:55,866
it enables you to notice social cues

1712
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,333
others may miss

1713
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:00,000
perhaps a hidden sadness you could coax out a little more 

1714
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:02,733
like we did with Sylvie

1715
01:19:02,966 --> 01:19:05,900
a strange joy from someone who should be bereaved

1716
01:19:07,566 --> 01:19:09,104
or a hidden resentment that

1717
01:19:09,104 --> 01:19:10,500
could return to harm you later

1718
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,276
this seems like I have to go with this

1719
01:19:12,276 --> 01:19:14,900
this is like therapy

1720
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:16,733
skill

1721
01:19:19,066 --> 01:19:22,100
any stat any low stat is not ideal

1722
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,266
all skills have their uses

1723
01:19:23,266 --> 01:19:25,100
good thing you can modify them with gear

1724
01:19:26,866 --> 01:19:29,700
so our empathy is actually pretty decent

1725
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:32,700
I think we need something in intellect

1726
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,166
I can't be this dumb

1727
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:40,366
practice the art of persuasion

1728
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:42,400
aw that yeah

1729
01:19:45,133 --> 01:19:46,900
electrochemistry has been a good skill

1730
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,700
maybe I should reward it it has been

1731
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,500
where is that

1732
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,000
electrochemistry see animal within you

1733
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,400
the beast longing to be unleashed

1734
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,366
to indulge and enjoy

1735
01:19:59,366 --> 01:20:02,566
enables you to take drugs with fewer negative side effects 

1736
01:20:02,566 --> 01:20:05,533
it also enables you to better investigate lurid matters

1737
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:07,063
if you need to understand a chemical breakdown 

1738
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:09,466
or talk to someone blasted out of their mind 

1739
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,100
understand sexual dynamics

1740
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,800
electrochemistry is there to guide you

1741
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:16,859
at high levels electrochemistry makes you a man of unrestrained  pleasure

1742
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:18,933
an unrepentant lothario

1743
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,800
who leers at people with a bottle of speed

1744
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,400
and a plastic bendy straw in either hand

1745
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:27,700
but with a low electrochemistry you'll be too innocent

1746
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,066
to be effective

1747
01:20:29,066 --> 01:20:31,200
without a working knowledge of drugs and sex

1748
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,933
the city will be difficult to understand

1749
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:36,700
okay so it's intact there

1750
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,600
I I can't be this stupid though

1751
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,600
I think I have to go with persuasiveness

1752
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,666
because that goes along with empathy

1753
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,666
debate make intellectual discourse nitpick and win

1754
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,566
enables you to break down arguments 

1755
01:20:51,566 --> 01:20:52,966
and hear what people are really saying

1756
01:20:52,966 --> 01:20:54,700
I think I have to do this

1757
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:59,133
if I'm roleplaying like a drugged out

1758
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:03,333
failed therapist turned dirty cop

1759
01:21:03,866 --> 01:21:04,733
which I think is

1760
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:07,000
what this playthrough is going to become

1761
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,733
like I try to be a therapist

1762
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:10,966
but

1763
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,366
I was too like married to my own impulses and

1764
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,500
the way I understand people is too chaotic

1765
01:21:20,533 --> 01:21:21,733
and I actually maybe I

1766
01:21:21,733 --> 01:21:23,800
understand them so well that I can't help but

1767
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,133
exploit them

1768
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:30,966
so to protect myself and everyone else from that I

1769
01:21:31,533 --> 01:21:33,500
uh switch to a career where I

1770
01:21:33,966 --> 01:21:36,500
where I have an immediate sense of authority

1771
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,376
over everyone else 

1772
01:21:37,376 --> 01:21:38,333
as a cop

1773
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:40,666
and I throw my weight around that way

1774
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:41,700
that sounds like a good

1775
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,866
character profile

1776
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,000
so I'm gonna go with rhetoric

1777
01:21:47,766 --> 01:21:48,700
let's level that up

1778
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,200
how many

1779
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,900
points do I actually have

1780
01:21:53,766 --> 01:21:54,566
just one

1781
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:57,066
all right

1782
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,251
could also save points for skill check

1783
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,166
stats of passive rows too okay

1784
01:22:05,733 --> 01:22:07,800
all right so this was

1785
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,966
a good way to just get started here

1786
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,900
I'm going to pause my recording and then we'll decide

1787
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,866
if we actually continue

1788
01:22:16,866 --> 01:22:18,800
but I want to be able to break these

1789
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,000
recordings up into chunks

1790
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,400
like I don't just want to upload like a

1791
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,733
6 hour thing to YouTube

1792
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:25,533
so yeah

1793
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:27,600
this is going to be our first little chapter here

1794
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,966
we've gotten a little bit of a grasp on who we are

1795
01:22:29,966 --> 01:22:31,133
where the fuck we are

1796
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,466
what's happening

1797
01:22:32,966 --> 01:22:34,933
we've got Kim in the mix Cuno is there

1798
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:37,766
he's an asset that we can rely on later

1799
01:22:37,966 --> 01:22:40,000
and I guess what we're going with is

1800
01:22:40,933 --> 01:22:43,733
failed therapist turned dirty cop

1801
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:47,766
who is sort of on 

1802
01:22:47,966 --> 01:22:50,000
the needle of whether or not he wants to be

1803
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,366
an addict or not

1804
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,600
so with that said I appreciate you

1805
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,666
enjoying this first look at Disco Elysium and

1806
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:58,966
we'll see where things go from there
