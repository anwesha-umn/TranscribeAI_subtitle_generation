1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,500
hello

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,666
and welcome back to my

3
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:05,300
therapist plays Disco Elysium analysis series

4
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:08,066
okay I'm really excited about today's episode

5
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,500
we're finally getting into our first

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,100
encounter with the union boss Evrart Claire

7
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,600
and kind of breaking down lots of different

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
psychological angles on power dynamics and

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,300
have a lot to share today on real techniques that

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,933
I actually use in my practice as a therapist

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,866
to navigate sort of like difficult conversations with people who

12
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,600
either don't want to talk to you

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,700
or are in some sort of power struggle

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,500
and how do you sort of get that person opening up about things

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,000
we're gonna use some of these techniques on Mister Claire

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,933
and by the end of this episode

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,700
we're going to learn a little bit more about

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,900
ourselves and what kind of cop we are

19
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:53,100
yes we're finally getting our cop type

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,666
I'm sure very few of you will be surprised at what I end up with

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,400
so I'm excited to share this one

22
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:00,566
let's dive in

23
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,700
okay so

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,333
I have an objective

25
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,366
I have the objective to progress this game storyline like

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,800
I do want to

27
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:16,466
just like

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,933
mention why I am going about playing this game this way

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,600
because I do think it's relevant

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,800
when you see my character

31
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:29,800
do things like just totally give up on pursuing the narrative

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,966
to try to find like cigarettes for example

33
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,100
this is a role play right

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,400
so sometimes I'm gonna be speaking as like Brady the therapist

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,500
sometimes I'm gonna be speaking as like

36
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,466
Brady the degenerate who is using this as a kind of

37
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:48,900
escapism from my very serious real life

38
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,133
that I

39
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,900
like this is where I get to give be a goofball

40
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,166
and sometimes I'm gonna like

41
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,366
speak from the voice of my character right

42
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:57,866
and just like

43
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:01,366
say random nonsense garbage that I think he would

44
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,000
say or think right

45
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,666
and one of the things that

46
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,366
it is really important about

47
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,000
this character specifically because he is

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,400
someone representing the struggle of addiction is how like

49
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,133
we have all kinds of priority structures in our mind

50
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,133
right like

51
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,400
there's the whole just basic needs hierarchy of

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,666
like you need food you need water you need rest

53
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,500
and only once those things are satisfied

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,966
can you really focus on like higher order things like 

55
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:40,600
you know your self esteem and your self worth and

56
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,133
the balance of health and your relationships

57
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,533
and those sorts of things right

58
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,733
the problem with addiction is that

59
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:51,866
your body has become dependent on on a chemical

60
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,133
one that is harmful to you

61
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:59,300
and so it completely hijacks what should be a normal

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,933
set of priorities right

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,966
and for example like your self esteem

64
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,566
when that is intact

65
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,566
and when you can focus on that as a priority

66
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:09,366
like

67
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,866
you may be able to say

68
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:13,700
okay I am going to go complete this task

69
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,100
I am gonna go talk to someone

70
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,000
I am going to ask this person what they think

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,366
I'm gonna canvass the scene I'm gonna do real

72
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,933
fucking police work okay

73
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,333
but that's like a higher order thing

74
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,300
my body being

75
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,866
chemically dependent on a substance is telling me no

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
this is more important this is basically

77
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,766
comparable to your body needs food

78
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,166
it needs this chemical right

79
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,533
like nicotine is a stimulant

80
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,366
so like that's hijacking basically like my

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,066
a sympathetic nervous system and telling me

82
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,266
like you're in danger without this thing right

83
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,200
opiates and

84
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,332
depressants like alcohol  

85
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:00,600
they hijack more

86
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,066
like the parasympathetic side of your nervous system

87
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,566
which is all about like the body being at rest

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
and so

89
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,933
imagine you are someone who is

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,533
addicted to both alcohol and cigarettes

91
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:14,466
and you have two halves of your nervous system

92
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:18,366
one that deals with very active compulsions

93
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:19,966
fight-or-flight response

94
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,000
that's your sympathetic and your parasympathetic

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,766
which is dealing with the body at rest

96
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,600
regulating heart rate and all that stuff

97
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:30,700
and you're doing a stimulant on one side

98
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,066
and a depressant on the other

99
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,300
and like they're just pulling you apart basically

100
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,686
and both sides are demanding

101
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:42,333
you keep this train going right

102
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,000
it's totally going to hijack

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,533
whatever like logical emotional empathetic sides of you

104
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,466
that have like all these fucking things to do

105
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,933
if this is your life

106
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,866
like how many things we have to do here

107
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:08,166
and we've only been like at this for like a day basically

108
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,633
how do you prioritize that

109
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,433
when when something is hijacking that whole system

110
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,300
and telling you like no the most

111
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,108
important thing that you do right now is

112
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,566
you find a way to like get high 

113
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,175
or you know 

114
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:25,900
you're not showing the intelligence

115
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,000
that you think you have in these conversations

116
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,966
so like you feel smarter when you're buzzed on nicotine

117
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:33,933
so go find a cigarette

118
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,600
right like that's the path I'm sort of role playing

119
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,933
when I'm like ooh I'm not gonna get distracted

120
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,733
actually stop everything

121
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,900
let's go find cigarettes like it's all a part of that

122
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,733
okay I'm trying to like represent

123
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:48,933
the struggle the real struggle

124
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,666
which this game is perfect at demonstrating

125
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,266
so far

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,066
probably worth saying that you already do have a past

127
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,333
so role playing as a therapist

128
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,000
might not come through much in the gameplay

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,700
well that's true

130
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,066
I've given up on that pursuit

131
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,400
because I didn't know that really when I started this

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,166
I thought that this game was gonna be like

133
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,700
just role play

134
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,023
I I didn't know that there was gonna be a

135
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:19,200
concrete narrative to my character

136
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,900
so I was just kind of like gonna put something in there

137
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,200
but I realized that

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,933
now that I've played some more

139
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,366
that's not really relevant so

140
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,466
yeah I mean like I'm very satisfied with the personal

141
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,900
narrative that our character has been through so far 

142
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:40,133
despite us not playing the game very well

143
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,066
I'm okay with it

144
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:48,533
so as I've already failed at my mission to progress this game 

145
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,866
let's continue let's fucking do it okay

146
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:54,866
what are we gonna do now

147
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,733
we gonna talk to the union boss

148
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,066
I gotta I gotta solve this murder

149
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,500
let's do that

150
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,066
what is this

151
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,133
the coffee and the giant thermoses is still lukewarm

152
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,766
okay we've made coffee recently

153
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,866
a stair made of pallets leading up

154
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,000
oh this must be the union boss

155
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:27,933
so he hangs out in like storage container

156
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,333
and office as this of

157
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,466
interesting environment

158
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:34,933
he's got here

159
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:35,466
where he got up there

160
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:36,533
swordfish

161
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:39,966
tells the time

162
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,500
until I run into another clerk look you guys

163
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,766
you guys are starting to detect my patterns

164
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,166
it's like

165
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,366
store clerks

166
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:03,933
there they're the unseen like pillars of society right

167
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,933
like everything goes through them

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,600
every chain of commerce and structure in society passes through 

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,200
like the the line of store clerk right like

170
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,666
your personal money goes to them

171
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,200
you buy your essentials

172
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,266
that goes back into the economy

173
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,100
they see everything

174
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,966
they've got hidden insights that

175
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,000
the rest of us could only dream of

176
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,300
it's store clerks and children

177
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,610
I have very passionate like

178
00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:44,933
feelings when I see hardships depicted for children

179
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,463
like I said I know I tried to hit Cuno 

180
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,366
but it's part of the role play

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,933
I'm doing what I think my character would do

182
00:08:53,966 --> 00:09:00,900
which is chase his erratic compulsive contradictory impulses 

183
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,400
okay let's talk to this gentleman

184
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,266
let's see what he's got to say for us he's very busy

185
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:08,566
before you

186
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:12,866
is the warrus of a man seated behind a large desk

187
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
he looks up from his work

188
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,266
not the least bit surprised to see you

189
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,566
okay this lean back hands behind the back of the head it's a

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
immediate power play okay

191
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,366
I'm putting my detective skills at work here

192
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:26,733
all right

193
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,833
this gentleman sees me with my flashlight

194
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:33,533
and now I feel like personified by wearing my coat

195
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,166
we're immediately in a power struggle

196
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,533
with great effort

197
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:44,300
he straightens himself up in his chair yet says nothing

198
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,700
he simply stares at you

199
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,100
look at this power play

200
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,166
he's trying to size me up

201
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,500
he wants to see what I'm all about

202
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,566
a typical power play

203
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,533
wait for him to speak first

204
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,733
show him you've got a backbone

205
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,766
what is happening in this play through

206
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:05,333
this is the weirdest real life

207
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
like

208
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,533
where my brain is cohesively attached to the game

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,766
this has never happened to me before

210
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:18,200
where like my direct thoughts get an immediate answer by

211
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,533
a game's narrative

212
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:23,133
this is scary

213
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,600
a typical power play yes

214
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,900
a volition coming in strong with a 12 point

215
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,166
wait for him to speak first

216
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,866
show him you've got a backbone

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
okay volition let's

218
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,300
say nothing look him dead in the eye

219
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:45,766
I wish the game

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,866
if the game

221
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,900
acknowledges that I have a flashlight in my hand

222
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:55,333
just like it acknowledged that I had a crowbar in my hand 

223
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,333
I'm gonna freak out

224
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,966
I'm blasting this guy with photosensitivity right now

225
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,166
the one good eye of this man

226
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,400
fills you up without even flickering the other

227
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,300
his lazy eye is constantly moving

228
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,333
like a goldfish in a tank

229
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:18,100
grotesquely magnified by his plus 6 glasses

230
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:20,000
a perception it's back intact

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,766
it's the fucking coat man

232
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,866
let's go this is a this is a boss fight

233
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,400
this is a boss fight of the mine

234
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,666
for a moment you don't know where to look

235
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
it is unbearably humid in the trailer

236
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,933
beads of sweat slide down the man's forehead

237
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,133
okay

238
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,866
I'm going to progress this a little bit

239
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,600
but then I'm going to tell you how

240
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,733
I actually in real life deal with

241
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:51,400
getting people who do not want to talk to you to like

242
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:52,766
give you information

243
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,733
again from the therapist's point of view like

244
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,166
the the reason I'm trying to get information from them

245
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,300
is to help them

246
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,533
like if I'm working with someone who is like

247
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,166
I don't want to fucking talk to you

248
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,766
and my interest is in like

249
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:09,500
talking about things will help you through this

250
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,300
how do you actually get that person to

251
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,366
like if you can't get them to trust you immediately

252
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:20,066
how do you just get them to start communicating

253
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,700
I'll I'll share one of my secret techniques

254
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,900
yet he's unperturbed holding his own

255
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
keep staring

256
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:28,966
endure this

257
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,000
endure this discomfort

258
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,733
at first nothing happens

259
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,500
his face wears a wide and self satisfied smile

260
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,933
every now and then he smacks his big lips

261
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,166
okay so I will tell you about it right now actually

262
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,166
because this is about power dynamics right

263
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,800
the game very clearly identified that so

264
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:58,300
there is a technique in

265
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,900
I wouldn't say even just like therapy

266
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,266
but it could very well apply to detective work as well

267
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,800
it's called the foot in the door technique okay

268
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,266
and here's how it works

269
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,400
it originated from

270
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,300
I think like

271
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,766
people making like house visits or something

272
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:18,533
like to individuals who needed help

273
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,366
I'm not totally sure on the history of this but

274
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,200
it's called foot in the door technique because

275
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:26,133
let's say that I already know I'm invited in somewhere

276
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,533
I don't need clearance to come into this person's house

277
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,666
like I've already gotten that

278
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,533
but I still ask them

279
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,333
may I come in please and they might say yes

280
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,266
I come inside

281
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:42,633
there is a social unspoken agreement

282
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,500
that like okay I'm now in your house

283
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,000
you sit down I'm okay to sit down

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,500
but what do I do instead I ask may I sit here

285
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:51,566
yes

286
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,566
right I may ask a few more questions like this

287
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:58,000
like do you mind if I cross my legs

288
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,366
do you mind if I you know take my shoes off right

289
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,933
you ask these kinds of questions to

290
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,766
someone who is you already know

291
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,600
is going to be kind of difficult to work with

292
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,133
do you understand why

293
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:17,100
why might I start asking questions that I already

294
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,866
know I'm going to get approval for

295
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,566
I'm curious if you can spot the answer

296
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,600
right in fact you may find that like

297
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:28,100
doing it too much the person starts to get like yes

298
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,700
I don't mind you know like just do

299
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,933
whatever you know you don't need my permission

300
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,933
can you guess

301
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:40,766
I'm curious to see

302
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,500
making them feel more in control

303
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,266
to show respect for their space

304
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,400
so Immortalzolris

305
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,466
you have it right

306
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:57,966
if you agree to one thing

307
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,333
you're more likely to agree to other things

308
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,333
is something called compliance momentum

309
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,200
basically right like

310
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,000
if you can get someone to comply

311
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,933
to something very simple

312
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,000
like may I come into this residence may I sit here

313
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,733
psychologically it has primed this person

314
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,933
that the beginning of your relationship is

315
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,466
they have already like

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,366
agreed to something with you

317
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:28,400
you have built an initial foundation of like

318
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,100
agreement collaboration and like this

319
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,866
very small very faint thread of like trust in someone

320
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,800
so it's called compliance momentum

321
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,566
that's what you can build with someone

322
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,200
and so like this is useful all the time

323
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,533
like I said I work with a lot of people who maybe

324
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:49,366
you know

325
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,500
being released from incarceration or something maybe

326
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,733
maybe on probation

327
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:59,919
the vast majority of them are actually pretty like fine  

328
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,566
and eager to actually start working with me like

329
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:04,666
I find that most people

330
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,533
especially after

331
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,866
you know going through something as difficult as that

332
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,500
they they're like yes I wanna work on myself like I really

333
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:17,500
you know appreciate this opportunity to learn more about myself

334
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
like I don't really have this issue very often

335
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,566
but there is the rare case where someone is just so

336
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,233
they've been so damaged and so like

337
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,533
learn to mistrust people

338
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,366
not to any of their own fault that

339
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,600
they're just totally

340
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,566
shut down and they don't want to talk to you

341
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:39,533
and so I will use a lot of compliance momentum right

342
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,900
you know I'll open my office door and like

343
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,066
I'll ask them

344
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:49,133
you know do you mind if I open the blinds a little bit right

345
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,300
you know do you mind if like I

346
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,100
have my notebook next to me

347
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,600
do you mind if I drink some water right

348
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,100
just little shit like that right

349
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,885
if I just start immediately asking them questions like  

350
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:07,366
hey so what are you feeling right now 

351
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,366
what's going on in your mind I will just

352
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,500
I'll just get that right

353
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,933
but even if I'm just getting a nod from them

354
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,600
if I'm even just getting a little bit of this 

355
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:18,800
communication

356
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,133
it's communication

357
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:23,066
we're working on the problem already right

358
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:25,566
so it's really useful for that

359
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,600
again the entire objective is to

360
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,200
build a kind of rapport so that you can help them so

361
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,733
that is exactly what I would be doing with this

362
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:35,700
gentleman right here

363
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,300
as he stares me into the abyss

364
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,166
I would start asking him questions

365
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,100
make him think he's in control of this okay

366
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,800
again

367
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,100
this is a role play

368
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,666
when I start like acting unhinged

369
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,300
as I'm talking like right now

370
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,600
that's that's Brady the character

371
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,400
when I'm like talking seriously that's like

372
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,133
that's me in real life okay I just

373
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,666
I'm gonna get in trouble with like certain

374
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,800
parts of the audience who are like you are bad

375
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,000
therapist

376
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,966
or something but like

377
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,100
that's okay you know like

378
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,766
part of what I'm doing is

379
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
trying to give a little bit of education

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,600
but then also like a little bit of dramatization right

381
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,533
I had a therapist do this when I was a teen

382
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,900
and I really didn't want to participate

383
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,266
well yeah no I mean

384
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,466
it doesn't always work right

385
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:46,847
it's a certain kind of technique for a very certain approach 

386
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:47,700
 and like I said

387
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,466
most of the time I do not have to do that

388
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,700
I I find generally that most people

389
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
are not on high alert you know if they're coming and

390
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,100
Iit's not like they learn five minutes ago

391
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,966
that they're gonna be meeting with a therapist

392
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,900
you know

393
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,066
they've already had time to sort of like think about uh

394
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,966
 what am I gonna get out of this and

395
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,700
I will always ask them like

396
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,000
have you been to therapy before

397
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,166
was it a good experience

398
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,800
if they say no

399
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,366
you know I'll ask them

400
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
you know to tell me a little bit about that and

401
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
whatever they say it was like

402
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,500
I immediately tried to mirror

403
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,966
that it's going to be something different than that

404
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,766
right

405
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:31,400
oh it did help me

406
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,700
I just realized what she was doing in retrospect

407
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,766
it's interesting yeah

408
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:36,966
there's also door

409
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:50,600
so that's what I would be doing with this gentleman

410
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,400
speaking of power dynamics I will also give you another

411
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,600
here I am I

412
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,100
we're progressing the narrative today

413
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,700
I don't care how long it takes okay

414
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,800
I've used this technique before

415
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,600
so like I immediately spotted when I was

416
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,333
starting to work with someone that they

417
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,066
they saw this as a power struggle

418
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,863
like the therapeutic relationship they thought 

419
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,333
 you know if you have the impression that like 

420
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,966
therapists are trying to get in your head

421
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,400
or get in your mind or something

422
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,500
you're gonna be kind of wary of that

423
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,666
and so like

424
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:35,566
I had someone come into the therapy room once and

425
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,166
you know there was my chair

426
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,666
and then there was a chair where like a client might sit 

427
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,300
and when I walked in I

428
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
just kind of ushered them into the room

429
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:49,300
and they sat in like my chair

430
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,133
and I could see there was a similar verbal 

431
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,433
like nonverbal communication

432
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,400
like there was a lean back there was like a

433
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,790
you know getting comfortable like 

434
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,733
 I've just sat in your chair

435
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,103
what are you gonna do now 

436
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,266
I'm the boss of this

437
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,533
and so what I did was I calmly just

438
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,133
took the seat for the client

439
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,966
and then just continued to do what I was doing

440
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
I didn't acknowledge this at all

441
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,200
I didn't participate in the power struggle like

442
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:19,700
when you don't participate in it it doesn't exist essentially 

443
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,700
and I ended up doing some very good work with that person 

444
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,000
and like it was actually

445
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,666
really helpful for building trust with them

446
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,200
because

447
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,733
they didn't feel like I was like ah

448
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,300
you know I'm I'm gonna

449
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,591
upset the power balance by doing this...

450
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,266
what what I think they got out of that was like

451
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:44,307
oh I don't need to like wear this mask for this person  

452
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:46,052
you know I don't need to

453
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:51,266
( I don't need to) be in a power dynamic with them

454
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,541
and so like we had a very good 

455
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,100
trusting therapeutic relationship from them 

456
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,533
Brady

457
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,933
play the game

458
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,700
we're in a power struggle here

459
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,200
sorry this stuff is just really interesting to me

460
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,400
let's go

461
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,866
like a general over his maps he plots his moves

462
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,266
judging by the way he is licking his chops

463
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,966
it's going to be a good one

464
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,133
okay authority help me out here

465
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,700
this is a power struggle so you know what to do

466
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
yes we've gotten him to speak

467
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:30,566
Mr Du Bois Mr Kitsuragi

468
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,396
how nice since you found a moment  

469
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:34,366
to pay a visit to the Debardeurs union

470
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:36,666
I'm Evrart Claier

471
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:38,900
head of this little operation here

472
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,866
who the fuck is Du Bois

473
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,166
please have a seat

474
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,700
he gestures to a *tiny* folding chair

475
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,600
opposite to his giant desk

476
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
what did I just say

477
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,495
what did I just say

478
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:57,066
 okay the way that your space is laid out 

479
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,266
people who see the world in terms of power dynamics like this 

480
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:09,533
consciously or unconsciously see every single environment 

481
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:14,400
as a field to do this kind of battle with 

482
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,447
only if you start assigning the same kind of like weight to it 

483
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:22,866
 does it actually work though

484
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,200
like I said I just let

485
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,500
if the client sits in my chair

486
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,600
I just sit in their chair

487
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,766
it's just a chair it's me right

488
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,866
the folding chair looks like a torture device

489
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,700
extremely uncomfortable

490
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,733
you go ahead detective

491
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:41,733
okay Kim Kim has got he's got my back this time

492
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:43,733
you know what we went through with measurehead

493
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:47,500
I feel like actually started to strengthen our bonds

494
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,866
especially after he like

495
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:51,400
he picked up that coin and gave it to me

496
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,766
like I've legitimately been thinking about this

497
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,566
that moment

498
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,866
like since I experienced it

499
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,800
this is where

500
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,600
Kim and I are on a sort of like compliance momentum

501
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
right like

502
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
that kind of shit would work with someone like my guy

503
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,466
what I'm finding

504
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:15,866
what I found at the beginning is that Kim would like

505
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,200
he would say

506
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:19,333
you take the lead

507
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,766
but then I would feel like he was undermining me right

508
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:22,666
or he

509
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,733
he would criticize my judgments or something like that

510
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,300
and what I'm finding now is

511
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:31,766
he's like

512
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,566
he's not just like seeing what I'm gonna do

513
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:36,966
he's kind of allowing me to

514
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,733
actually take the leader

515
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,966
whatever he has in store for you

516
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:47,000
it can't be good

517
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,533
he thinks I'll do my best

518
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:52,900
yeah do not be surprised if this conversation

519
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:54,310
takes us two hours 

520
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,766
because I already have a lot to say about it 

521
00:24:57,533 --> 00:25:00,533
it's just like I cannot be anyone but myself

522
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,566
unfortunately

523
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,766
forget about that

524
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:07,466
what's with this De Bois stuff

525
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:11,200
you're getting some seriously bad vibes from that name

526
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:13,300
yeah I don't really know

527
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:15,583
I'll be honest though I'm gonna

528
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:20,900
just like admit that I've been spoiled on the fact that like 

529
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,366
Raphael

530
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:26,533
Ambrosius Costeau is not my name

531
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,100
it's harry like that's just

532
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,066
that's just a result of uploading stuff to YouTube and

533
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:33,866
people get excited

534
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,666
I understand that

535
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:39,000
so I'm already aware that

536
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,866
we have...that Raphael was a fake name

537
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,066
I think that's pretty cool

538
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:45,866
I actually see it as

539
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:51,300
it fits in line with Inland Empire here

540
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,100
which to me

541
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,266
Inland Empire has been the force that is trying to

542
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,000
keep you from figuring out who you were

543
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,000
right it's one of the competing mental states that is

544
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,900
in one sense you could say well it's on your side

545
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:09,900
it's trying to help you

546
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,666
it's empathizing

547
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,333
it's telling you like don't get involved with who you were 

548
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,966
it makes you feel bad it has a bad vibe to it

549
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:20,266
build a new personality from where you are right

550
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,400
but from my point of view

551
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,866
as the therapist and really just as a human

552
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:28,066
like I think that

553
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:32,074
this is a kind of avoidance right

554
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:33,566
 I want to

555
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:37,900
approach who I was but in a sensitive and slow way

556
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:39,966
I haven't looked in the mirror yet for example

557
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,000
I haven't discovered what my name was

558
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,933
I think right now

559
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:46,133
where my character is at

560
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,366
especially after seeing those bottles on the ground

561
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,266
going back into our bedroom

562
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:52,666
like we're starting to get a little more comfortable

563
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:56,166
with the idea of approaching our past self 

564
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,100
we're wearing the coat for example

565
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,933
but we're not sure if we like that person yet

566
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:09,133
I think that right now I would be saying something like

567
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,600
why are you calling me Mr Dubois

568
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,366
but that would upset the power dynamic

569
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,733
so I'm just going to

570
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,200
what did Kim tell me to do

571
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,400
I don't want to undermine him either

572
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,766
Kim told me to

573
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:29,966
sit in the chair so I'm going to listen to Kim

574
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,366
we are two and he is one

575
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:37,500
we've got a we've got a standstrong in this one

576
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,000
take a seat

577
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,533
excellent Mr Dubois

578
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:41,866
I can see that you are a reasonable man

579
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,533
and reasonable men

580
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,700
reasonable men can be of great use to one another

581
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:50,300
remain serious

582
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,133
stick through this

583
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,500
so tell me how can the head of the Debardes union

584
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,200
help a representative of the Revershal Citizens militia today 

585
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,000
okay starting off with

586
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,133
letting me clarify my purpose here

587
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:11,800
we know that there's another purpose here okay

588
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,366
I'm here to arrest you or I don't know

589
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:15,866
the chair you're sitting on has

590
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:19,208
got to be the most uncomfortable chair in the world  

591
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,266
it's *violating* your backside

592
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:25,733
by the way

593
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:28,666
I heard you got a rather rude reception from a certain

594
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:30,100
Lawrence *Garte*

595
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,133
some people have no manners it pains me to say

596
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:35,333
he's trying to sympathize with me

597
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,366
he's trying to draw me into his little game

598
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,133
I don't like it I see right through

599
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,466
*this* should take care of that nonsense

600
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,566
hmm it's a bribe

601
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:52,798
he points to a giant novelty cheque on his desk  

602
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,766
it's absolutely comically huge

603
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,766
it should be sufficient to cover your expenses for a few days 

604
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,666
and patch over your differences with a cafeteria manager 

605
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:02,600
go ahead take it

606
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,100
so he wants me to become dependent on him  

607
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,264
not gonna work fellow

608
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,766
hey that's 25 real

609
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,400
that's good money

610
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:14,200
think of all the *stuff* you could

611
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,966
okay electrochemistry coming in doing exactly what I

612
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,266
said it would do right

613
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:23,196
electrochemistry is

614
00:29:23,883 --> 00:29:26,933
in my interpretation could be wrong but

615
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,666
the voice that it often speaks from

616
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,600
the way I see it is from the nervous system

617
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:36,766
it is the priority structure at the foundational layer

618
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:40,217
which gets hijacked by impulses and desires 

619
00:29:40,217 --> 00:29:45,466
 it's basically like the ID right in like a Freudian sense 

620
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:51,933
the thing is is like in real life listening to volition

621
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,466
and and like a

622
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:57,466
savoir fair like the things that are good for you

623
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,300
they take a lot of effort

624
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:02,933
it takes me a lot of effort to like eat a healthy meal

625
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,133
one it's more expensive

626
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:07,066
two I have to spend time like planning it

627
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,566
thinking about the calorie intake

628
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:12,266
making sure it's like you know 

629
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,166
I have time to prepare it and all these things

630
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,766
like it's way easier to just go eat junk food

631
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:19,800
it's not as good for me

632
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,566
logically and morally I know it's not as good for me

633
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:26,800
but it is harder to listen to volition

634
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,700
and things that are good for you

635
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,961
the voices that are good for you because they take more  effort 

636
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,600
it's way easier to listen to like electrochemistry

637
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,400
because it deals in base impulses and

638
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:42,766
my character has a substance use issue 

639
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,733
that has rewired his priorities

640
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:47,733
there is some tension here between

641
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,366
I'm trying to stick to the high effort stay composed

642
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:54,300
don't show that you're in pain

643
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,700
but I'm also thinking I could buy a lot of cigarettes with that 

644
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,866
......*owe*him for?

645
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,100
this is a trap

646
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,100
I don't want to show that I

647
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,300
don't know the relation here

648
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:22,700
I don't want

649
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,400
some part of me wants me to wants to keep up the

650
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:31,600
idea that like we're in collaboration here

651
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:34,766
but I also think it would be a fucking power

652
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,300
play to just deny the check

653
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:41,733
the thing is is a little bit of me makes me feel like

654
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,200
having

655
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:46,000
having my partner with me

656
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:48,000
makes me feel like

657
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,866
like that's a certain kind of pressure as well

658
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:54,566
like I've embarrassed myself in front of Kim so many times 

659
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:01,466
that that's a source of anxiety

660
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:02,900
that's competing with the like

661
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,945
well what if I can't buy my next

662
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:06,766
substance or something

663
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:11,571
what will Kim think 

664
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:12,960
yeah he probably disapprove

665
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,866
 keep it

666
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,500
okay okay

667
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,200
I respect a man with principles

668
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,066
no handouts then 

669
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,925
he crosses his arms on his ample midsection  

670
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:25,533
and sinks further into his chair

671
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:26,466
okay so

672
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,966
change in body posture

673
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,800
okay

674
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,400
wide open stance like this

675
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,329
I'm in control 

676
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,700
arms across the chest

677
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,800
I'm feeling a little defensive

678
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,566
now I'd like to set your mind at

679
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:42,533
ease about one other matter

680
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,000
your *lost gun*

681
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,670
let me assure you 

682
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,200
union people are on it as we speak

683
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,400
I've got my best hounds looking for that *lost gun*

684
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,600
it does seem like

685
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,933
we are previously intertwined with this gentleman

686
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:00,466
and he knows that

687
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:02,970
his slug like lips move 

688
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,466
but all you hear is an echo

689
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:09,166
lost gun lost gun lost gun

690
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,733
what he does not know though is that we

691
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,762
have lost our memory 

692
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:16,200
because he's operating on like

693
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:20,566
an assumption that：I know what the fuck he's talking about when I don't 

694
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:24,300
the world is swallowed by a black hole of fear

695
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:28,866
only two words escape its gravitational pull

696
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,900
*lost* and *gun*

697
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,566
but I don't need my gun

698
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:38,100
I have not needed it once

699
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,500
if I just take a look at my character okay

700
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:44,333
I have already demonstrated that I

701
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:47,266
have the physical prowess to take down measure head

702
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,250
you did have a conversation about losing your gun though

703
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,333
well but with Kim

704
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:01,600
it's part of me being a decent cop

705
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,600
but I want to show confidence here

706
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,766
keeping your shit together

707
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,400
that's okay I'm not worried

708
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,366
I don't need a fucking gun

709
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,200
what did I call them

710
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:14,866
viper and

711
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:18,666
I forget whatever he called his arms

712
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,703
the union have eyes and ears that's okay 

713
00:34:23,703 --> 00:34:25,600
I got this

714
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,533
Kim's got a gun

715
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,400
are you all right Harry

716
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,000
you say you got this

717
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,966
but you seem a little *anxious* to me

718
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,400
don't be everything's going to be all right 

719
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,200
anxious I'm not anxious

720
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,100
little anxious

721
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,966
it's not like you left it loaded

722
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:45,000
you didn't lose a *loaded gun*

723
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,466
local children aren't out there playing with it right now 

724
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,900
pointing it into their own mouth

725
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,300
it's in a safe place

726
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,533
I just know it

727
00:34:53,566 --> 00:34:56,933
I have a feeling everything's going to be alright

728
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,000
he's trying to he's trying to set me up

729
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,166
it was loaded

730
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,133
there were two bullets in it

731
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,466
you always keep at least two barrels loaded

732
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:08,400
shit

733
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:12,766
okay I don't have an option here this

734
00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:16,600
don't panic

735
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,066
I mean there's no harm in

736
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:22,500
doing this right

737
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,800
look I

738
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,866
just accept I am never really going to figure out this system 

739
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:29,666
okay

740
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:33,733
I know it's killing some people to watch me play this and be like 

741
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,700
this is how the check system works like

742
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:39,466
I'm gonna re-evaluate whether this works every single time 

743
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
I guess I could get Kim involved here

744
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,766
let's get Kim involved first

745
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:52,133
officer we will deal with this later

746
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,733
we don't need Mr Claire's help with this

747
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,200
we're on the same track

748
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,533
we're on the same track

749
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,166
be so sure about that

750
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,866
but I have to choose this now

751
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:07,266
well I guess I have no other choice

752
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:13,666
whatever watch me

753
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,900
watch me fucking compose myself like you've never even seen before 

754
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,966
God you're sweating

755
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,933
your knee is jerking

756
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:23,066
you're about to cry aren't you

757
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,866
you are about to cry

758
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,500
because you lost your gun

759
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,366
and those children are going to shoot themselves with it 

760
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,400
no they are not

761
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,500
I mean they could

762
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:33,500
so what men can cry too

763
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,766
you *want* to cry

764
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,000
God you're weak

765
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,533
whatever you do

766
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,900
don't cry you'll think you're disgusting

767
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,500
God damn it

768
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,566
*Mr.Du bois* you don't look so good

769
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,000
hold it in Harry cry later

770
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,166
it'll be it'll be time for healing later

771
00:36:57,166 --> 00:37:00,535
what is this *Mr.Du bois* he keeps repeating 

772
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,640
*what* is he trying to pull here

773
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:02,660
*what* is he trying to pull here
Open it. Tell her to open the store.

774
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,319
*what* is he trying to pull here

775
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,933
you need to cool the fuck down

776
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:06,933
chill

777
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,756
kim

778
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:09,466
back me up

779
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,806
put your hand on my shoulder or something 

780
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:14,492
Mr Dubois

781
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:17,066
Mr Dubois Harry

782
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,200
keep sliding down

783
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,866
this chair like a jello shot

784
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:28,266
there are no *harries*

785
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,066
let your mind go to a safe place

786
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:31,966
yes use your coping skills

787
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:40,900
while Everart is distracted by your odd behavior

788
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:43,797
the lieutenant's eyes are mapping everything around

789
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:44,866
the folder

790
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:47,200
desk papers on the wall

791
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,666
investigate him Kim

792
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,063
Mr.Du bois are you okay

793
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,442
can I get you a glass of water or something

794
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,000
are you having some kind of medical emergency

795
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:02,800
look we're doing we're doing healthy cop sick cop

796
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,533
all right while he's all focused on me

797
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,133
crumbling to little pieces in front of him

798
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:09,466
he's enjoying this

799
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,359
okay he's living for this 

800
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:12,900
he's paying no

801
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,800
mind

802
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,066
to the stalwart studious

803
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:17,566
composed

804
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,333
Kim Kitsuragi behind me

805
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,266
scoping out his whole fuckin game plan okay

806
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,400
he's taken all of this information in

807
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:26,200
and if I have to

808
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,333
let my ego die

809
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,533
to progress this case then I will do it

810
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:36,046
I will do it 

811
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,733
and we will succeed in spite

812
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,066
of how broken I am as a person

813
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:47,133
maybe you could use your hands somehow

814
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,266
in a kind of throwing motion

815
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,566
like your throwing that Mr.Du Bios act right back at him

816
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,966
*he's* Mr Dubois

817
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:56,862
I'm melting 

818
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,300
actually this chair is uncomfortable

819
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,733
I could use that glass of water

820
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:03,566
hmm oh yeah man I'm fucking great keep sliding

821
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,566
nah I'm good as it gets

822
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,300
Mr Dubois

823
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,400
vaguely gesture with your hands above your head

824
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,700
umm...

825
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:20,400
I don't like any of these options but

826
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,166
that's just life 

827
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,984
that's just life sometimes 

828
00:39:24,984 --> 00:39:27,566
I don't like like all of life's options either 

829
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:31,933
again I'm gonna try to remain as composed

830
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,166
I can install for time

831
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,700
Kim is scoping the scene right now

832
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,500
what an odd demonstration

833
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,733
of huh

834
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,166
you got me Harry

835
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,766
I don't even know what

836
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,300
as entertaining as it was

837
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,533
I'm afraid we're wasting our time

838
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,366
and I'm an extremely busy man as I'm sure you are too

839
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,366
I am very busy

840
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:57,141
okay enough we are here to ask you some questions

841
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:59,500
pertaining to a murder investigation

842
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:00,466
yeah

843
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,400
investigate him Kim and then let‘s arrest him

844
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,266
quick here's your window

845
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:08,400
get yourself together and ask him questions

846
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:10,533
police officer questions

847
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,900
reaction speed let's go

848
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,466
it is about time to stop embarrassing yourself

849
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:16,266
questions will help you regain

850
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,133
some of your lost dignity

851
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,466
thank you volition

852
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:21,966
I appreciate

853
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,100
that

854
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,347
this whole series  

855
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,366
has been about embarrassing myself

856
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:33,733
okay

857
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,366
let's hesitate on on asking questions about ourselves

858
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,034
we want to find out

859
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:44,866
what the union is involved with the drug trade okay

860
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,200
this all gets back to

861
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:49,866
lady at the docks

862
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:52,733
pier Joyce

863
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
she knows something about the case

864
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,966
she won't talk to us cause I don't have my badge

865
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,333
I don't have my badge cause I am a wreck of a human

866
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:10,223
she'll only do so if we get the drugs out of Martinaise 

867
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:12,400
so I'm confronting him

868
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:15,648
so we can figure out where the drugs are

869
00:41:16,137 --> 00:41:17,866
and then solve that

870
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,000
and then talk to Joyce

871
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,466
and she'll help us solve the murder

872
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:23,533
and then I will impress Cuno

873
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:27,150
okay I just need to recap where I'm at here

874
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:34,733
I am looking into your shady brew

875
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,900
I'm told the union is involved in the local drug trade

876
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,166
let's ask him

877
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:46,566
well

878
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:50,100
some questions that's not a question that's a statement

879
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,966
so I should really go with like

880
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:55,800
what's in the container that's outside your office

881
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,050
okay let's try the compliance momentum all right

882
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,500
let's get him to answer some very simple questions

883
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,600
so that he is primed to answer more complicated ones 

884
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,066
my dear Harry

885
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,333
there are literally millions of containers in this harbour 

886
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,466
I couldn't possibly remember what's in all of them

887
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,666
there's something special about it

888
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:16,900
it was attached to the Kvalsund crane

889
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,766
Harry you smooth talking son of a bitch

890
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,666
time is a precious resource

891
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,200
and I don't have enough of it

892
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,666
to count containers with you

893
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,933
sounds like you're getting a little anxious buddy

894
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:29,166
smooth talking

895
00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:33,700
maybe that's the way to go about opening the container

896
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,566
you should at least try convincing it

897
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:39,000
I already tried that it didn't work

898
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:41,300
okay let's try another tactic here

899
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,933
aren't you going to ask me how I got in

900
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:48,500
am I going to ask

901
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:53,066
hell Harry you spin kicked my strongest man in the face

902
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,766
I saw it from my window

903
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,196
yeah well you should be scared

904
00:42:56,196 --> 00:42:58,366
cause I'll spin kick the fuck out of you right now

905
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,666
would you ask a man like that

906
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,966
how he got into your container yard

907
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,733
he doesn't have a window that's a good point

908
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,800
it was a figure of speech Harry

909
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,066
of course I don't have a window I'm in a container

910
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:18,666
this is this is a very subtle battle of our wits

911
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:21,066
or maybe I really do sound like an idiot

912
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:22,733
I genuinely don't know at this point

913
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,666
anyway I assure you I am a very well informed man

914
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:28,333
information reaches me

915
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,733
before I even get the chance to request it

916
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:34,966
let's change subjects before we get into this

917
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,500
you call me Mr Du Bois

918
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:38,533
why

919
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:41,966
of course let us dispatch with the formalities

920
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,533
you call me Evrart

921
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:44,866
I call you Harry

922
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,866
that's what the hang of the corpse called you Harry

923
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,200
so that's really my name

924
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,966
my God so it's true

925
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,766
I didn't want to believe it

926
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:55,450
but you are a fantastic science fiction 

927
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,975
amnesiac cop aren't you

928
00:43:56,975 --> 00:43:58,366
what are the odds of that

929
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,300
figured me out

930
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:01,600
are very low

931
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:06,866
my memory is fine I'm just testing you

932
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,166
where do we go with the honest question

933
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,733
the honest statement here

934
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:18,566
let's uh let's let's hold our grout

935
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:20,866
so good to hear that Harry

936
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,966
apparently my sources were wrong

937
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,200
however if you did have a spot of memory trouble

938
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,400
I could help you out

939
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,333
with my big fat folder

940
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:29,783
no

941
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:30,933
are you trying to tell me

942
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:33,200
you've gotten a hold of some of our documents

943
00:44:35,566 --> 00:44:38,600
let's go Kim I knew you would be on it

944
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,933
Mr Kitsuragi would you mind

945
00:44:41,366 --> 00:44:44,733
me and Harry are talking about his lost identity right now 

946
00:44:44,966 --> 00:44:47,466
asking too many questions will make you look weak

947
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:49,466
you should maybe focus on the folder

948
00:44:49,466 --> 00:44:50,600
what the hell

949
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,700
volition you just told me to ask him questions

950
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:59,766
I did read the shipping folders but it's not a

951
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,800
there's no way I can pass that right now

952
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,266
let's just keep asking him things

953
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,050
uhhhh

954
00:45:15,066 --> 00:45:16,700
maybe I will circle back to this

955
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:18,700
or let's just ask him where he got it

956
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,800
ah this

957
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,933
my friends in your organization gave it to me Harry

958
00:45:22,966 --> 00:45:25,333
I find that very suspicious

959
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:26,566
may I have a look

960
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:27,933
put the squeeze on him Kim

961
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,666
I'm afraid this is meant for union eyes only

962
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:33,466
Mr Kitsuragi I'm sure you understand

963
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,400
please continue Harry

964
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,666
Kim suspect something

965
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,700
and I've read the folders before

966
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:45,766
this increased my chances

967
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:48,333
do I have any skill points to put into drama

968
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,133
no

969
00:45:56,966 --> 00:46:00,366
I can't ask him too many questions

970
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:07,133
what kind of cop does it say I am lets try that

971
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:10,666
well Harry if I were to sum you up in one word

972
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:12,500
it would be apologetic

973
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,733
I'm sorry

974
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,366
yes

975
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:19,800
you seem to be

976
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,500
a lot of the time

977
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,066
but right now there's no reason to be

978
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,533
let loose a little

979
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:26,766
be you

980
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:35,100
we are learning more things about ourselves okay

981
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:39,293
if I am my character if I'm Harry 

982
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:43,133
and I am starting to become invested in the idea of 

983
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,666
how much do I really want to know about myself

984
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:47,600
there are things I

985
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,733
there are some virtues I can detect

986
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:52,133
that make me want to do this

987
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:54,333
but there are some things I'm very terrified of

988
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,905
I am very scared of learning

989
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:58,633
that I am not a good person

990
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,566
I'm very scared of learning that I am actually not a good cop 

991
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:06,583
that people don't see me as one that they don't like me right

992
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,660
I'm scared of the idea that the reason I lost my memory is

993
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,925
because I tried to do something to myself

994
00:47:11,925 --> 00:47:13,733
because I hated myself

995
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,550
that's a terrifying thought

996
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:21,366
 but like building the profile of someone who is invested in healing 

997
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,166
there is a hesitation to learn these things

998
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:30,200
but there is an innate desire to learn them 

999
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,700
let's get this straight

1000
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,566
what's my full name

1001
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:38,666
it's Harry Harry Du Bois

1002
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:39,375
okay

1003
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,758
you feel like a Du Bois

1004
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,333
but you don't feel like a Harry

1005
00:47:44,966 --> 00:47:45,981
strange

1006
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:49,400
you don't feel like any of these things

1007
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,266
you know what your name is

1008
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,400
you have a sophisticated name

1009
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:56,933
like that of a ccount or a beautiful man

1010
00:47:57,866 --> 00:48:00,566
well that's bullshit that's not how we really feel

1011
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:04,366
that's not my name my name is Raphael Costeau

1012
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:12,075
okay I like it I can work with that 

1013
00:48:12,075 --> 00:48:13,300
it's not so bad

1014
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,866
Harry Dubois I like it it's a cool name

1015
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:21,333
ah yeah

1016
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,166
I failed at this

1017
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:23,966
okay

1018
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,933
and I can work with you Harry

1019
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
now what else can I do for you

1020
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:32,800
let's ask some other questions

1021
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,466
of course Harry of course

1022
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,489
I met Joyce

1023
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:37,933
let`s not linger on personal details and amnesia

1024
00:48:37,933 --> 00:48:39,500
you wanted something from me

1025
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:46,766
or let's talk about my lost gun I guess

1026
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:49,258
maybe I can get some more information about the folder there

1027
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:51,066
yes your lost gun 

1028
00:48:51,425 --> 00:48:52,933
my best men are on it

1029
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,666
they're turning every stone searching every playground

1030
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,700
asking kids grandmas everyone

1031
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:00,733
I find that hard to believe

1032
00:49:00,733 --> 00:49:03,000
your gun will be found Harry

1033
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:04,800
let me assure you of that

1034
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,500
it's just a matter of time and effort

1035
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:12,166
the only way to find it seems to be working with him

1036
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,700
he might even be holding your gun hostage

1037
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,933
hold on could he really hold my gun hostage 

1038
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:25,133
I will not be blackmailed with this gun business

1039
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:27,166
yeah I'm not gonna succumb to that

1040
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,866
Harry Harry I was only trying to be tactful

1041
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,300
a lost gun is a dangerous thing

1042
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:35,800
I can't have it around in my neighborhood

1043
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:39,300
kids could be playing gun roulette with it as we speak

1044
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:42,066
teenage gangs could be arming themselves

1045
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,933
get ahold of yourself Harry

1046
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,466
he has mentioned children a lot

1047
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:58,300
I don't think that was here

1048
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:04,966
yeah but he he's he's pushing a lot on the kids angle

1049
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:09,733
I think I have to go investigate

1050
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:10,500
I assure you

1051
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,500
we are working on locating the missing side armor as well 

1052
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:16,266
the lieutenant is concerned about the lost gun

1053
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,400
and feels that

1054
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,000
the fact you haven't prioritized looking for it

1055
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,133
is unfortunate

1056
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,366
if inevitable

1057
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:25,166
and doesn't put the RCM in a good light

1058
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,241
well what am I supposed to do Kim

1059
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:29,666
do I stop all of this to find the gun

1060
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,900
or do I work with the shady guy to get it

1061
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,400
I can't do them both

1062
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,933
excellent Mr Kitsuragi

1063
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,766
that's excellent news

1064
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:38,533
looks like we have a friendly

1065
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:40,866
gun finding competition on our hands

1066
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,133
okay

1067
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,266
we're back in the power struggle this is it's intense

1068
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,533
this is way harder than the

1069
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:50,166
confrontation with measure head

1070
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,333
let's see what he thinks about Joyce

1071
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,933
oh that's very nice

1072
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:59,166
I haven't gotten around to her yet

1073
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,266
I'm very very busy you see

1074
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,200
I hope you're getting along

1075
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,700
one thing I want to make very clear Harry

1076
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,800
is that this is not some kind of union

1077
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,933
versus corporation situation

1078
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,000
everyone is just pals here

1079
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,066
just pals

1080
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:16,000
we're all trying to do what's best for Martinaise

1081
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:18,533
don't feel like you can't cooperate with her

1082
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,333
because you and I are such good friends

1083
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,400
and I'm helping you find your lost gun

1084
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,133
I'm not a jealous guy

1085
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,600
that's so nice of him

1086
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:30,733
suspiciously nice

1087
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,566
are you sure I find it a little odd

1088
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,333
ooh we could press on the Mr Gaunont angle

1089
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:47,333
Joyce said the previous union leader vanished under

1090
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,266
let's just ask him what happened

1091
00:51:49,266 --> 00:51:52,232
 let's see what his false narrative is

1092
00:51:52,232 --> 00:51:55,850
so that I have a little bit more room to investigate him 

1093
00:51:56,566 --> 00:52:00,150
what do you mean Harry nothing I let him go

1094
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,933
he made concessions for the company in previous negations since 

1095
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:08,333
why would you let an ally like that go

1096
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,866
he's an old man Harry

1097
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:13,000
I wanted him to spend more time with his family

1098
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,300
god knows how long he's got left

1099
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,333
you called him a midget

1100
00:52:19,566 --> 00:52:20,333
let's confront him

1101
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,900
Harry I have little people in my organization

1102
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:26,066
I would never call someone a midget

1103
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:27,100
what is this

1104
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:30,266
honestly I'm beginning to think you're a midget Harry

1105
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:33,666
I'm only kidding Harry you're not a midget

1106
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,533
no one is we're pals

1107
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:37,533
I thought you just said you would never call someone that 

1108
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:39,300
and then you went back on your word

1109
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,333
it's hard to say if he really lost his temper

1110
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:47,900
or if this is another one of his tricks

1111
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:52,333
this man almost never angers visibly

1112
00:52:52,866 --> 00:52:56,050
okay so disarming him in some ways

1113
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:02,000
it's about challenging his character

1114
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,733
not his power

1115
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:07,966
his character he doesn't like it when his character is challenged 

1116
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:10,866
are you sure I find a little odd

1117
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,866
I'm just a nice guy Harry

1118
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,400
I wouldn't be where I am now if I wasn't nice

1119
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
I'm sure you believe that

1120
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,300
 politics is all about emotions

1121
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,933
and I want you to have positive emotion

1122
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:21,600
when you think of me

1123
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,466
okay then positive emotions it is

1124
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,266
you like positive

1125
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:26,866
no

1126
00:53:26,866 --> 00:53:28,966
no electrochemistry stop it

1127
00:53:28,966 --> 00:53:30,066
you're intruding

1128
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:34,266
why haven't you let her in to see you

1129
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:35,733
let's challenge his character

1130
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,191
he does not like the idea that

1131
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:41,166
I'm positioning his character as being inconsistent 

1132
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,466
let's go in

1133
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,100
if she actually wants to see me she will find a way

1134
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,225
voices raising up

1135
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:53,533
and I just don't have anything to discuss with a bad negotiator 

1136
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,866
I feel like that's an honest statement

1137
00:53:57,933 --> 00:54:00,400
I feel like he's there's no mask behind that

1138
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:05,333
he doesn't want to see her

1139
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,733
it's as simple as that

1140
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:13,400
he's starting to be a little more uh disarmed

1141
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:20,475
let's push on the union leader angle 

1142
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:21,133
vanished

1143
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:23,933
Harry the woman left her casserole in the oven

1144
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,366
and couldn't make it here in time for the voting

1145
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,766
oh did I leave my casserole on

1146
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,300
better go home and check

1147
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,000
the election can wait

1148
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:34,333
when she got back the whole thing was over

1149
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:40,766
Evrart Joyce seems to think the union is low balling her

1150
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,266
low balling

1151
00:54:42,266 --> 00:54:43,100
of course

1152
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,200
this isn't a casino Harry

1153
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:48,166
real people real livelihoods are at stake here

1154
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:50,966
but everything's a casino for those rich types

1155
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
his expression makes it clear

1156
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,766
this is childish and irresponsible behavior

1157
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:01,900
okay let's talk about something else

1158
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,766
of course Harry let me just assure you one more time

1159
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,900
it's perfectly okay

1160
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,366
to share anything we discuss here with this Joyce

1161
00:55:11,566 --> 00:55:14,466
this is a completely transparent organization

1162
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:15,183
I feel

1163
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:17,733
I have no interest in what she is doing

1164
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:19,933
but I myself have nothing to hide

1165
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,600
bullshit

1166
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,900
your business is your business and I respect your privacy

1167
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:27,566
just remember none of this is secret 

1168
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,100
he's trying to give me a false sense of security here

1169
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:35,300
my brother's picture my singing swordfish clock

1170
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,400
tell her how overweight I am

1171
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,966
and how I'm helping you find your lost gun

1172
00:55:40,408 --> 00:55:42,100
tell her about everything

1173
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,933
Evrart art doesn't mind

1174
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,700
that's so suspicious

1175
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,066
this is weird

1176
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,400
not nice weird but okay

1177
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,800
yeah

1178
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:57,266
I want to talk about the hanging

1179
00:55:57,266 --> 00:56:00,266
oh of course that's your main thing here

1180
00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:02,766
that's why you're in Martinaise

1181
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,566
I know everything that goes on around here

1182
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:07,133
and I would love to help

1183
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:09,500
like I'm helping you with your lost gun

1184
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,755
I mean it's no secret

1185
00:56:11,755 --> 00:56:14,266
that the ynching is connected to the strike

1186
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:15,733
so much to talk about

1187
00:56:15,866 --> 00:56:18,933
honestly it's been weighing on me so heavily

1188
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,566
I understand you need to interview me

1189
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,333
say nothing

1190
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,166
but there's a thing that's been keeping me up at night

1191
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:32,300
I want to talk about the hanging

1192
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,000
I mean if we could just calmly talk

1193
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,266
now fuck he's gonna tell me I need to do something for him first 

1194
00:56:39,283 --> 00:56:40,133
This guy

1195
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:41,666
yes that sounds good

1196
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:42,966
let's do that

1197
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,800
but I can't think straight

1198
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,166
with this thing weighing on me

1199
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:48,333
you are police officers aren't you

1200
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,966
I have a crazy idea

1201
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,266
you guys are basically door opening machines

1202
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,866
incredibly talented at opening doors

1203
00:57:00,866 --> 00:57:02,700
I've opened a few doors in my life

1204
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:03,733
let's see where this is going

1205
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:04,666
and I'm sure you're gonna

1206
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:07,066
open this one with flying colors Harry

1207
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,500
this really is very simple

1208
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,333
and there's nothing shady about it

1209
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:14,266
oh that that that's what I was waiting for I needed to

1210
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:16,900
first I needed to hear him say that it's not shady

1211
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,266
and now I think it isn't

1212
00:57:19,183 --> 00:57:20,480
come on man

1213
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,733
does this jiggling ooze think he's going to use you

1214
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:25,766
he's got another thing coming

1215
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:27,566
play his game son

1216
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:29,466
with your eyes peeled

1217
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,366
he's going to slip up

1218
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,066
and when he does you're going to come out on top

1219
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:37,466
fucking God damn right

1220
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:41,350
that's the force that defeated measure head okay

1221
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:45,166
now it's coming in with the intellect 

1222
00:57:52,266 --> 00:57:53,366
whose door is it

1223
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:57,166
oh no one's it's just a weasel a weasel lives there

1224
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,766
nothing for you to worry about

1225
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,466
why are you asking me to do it then

1226
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:01,966
why not just open it yourself

1227
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:03,404
Harry I'm a very busy man

1228
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:05,000
and more importantly

1229
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,800
I don't have that extraordinary fizzy cue do

1230
00:58:08,191 --> 00:58:10,566
you look like you could run around all day

1231
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,500
I probably could

1232
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:14,200
you want to send someone a message

1233
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,133
that the police are working for you

1234
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:19,375
that's right

1235
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:23,000
I repeat I'm a very very busy man Mr Kitsuragi 

1236
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,100
and therefore I must occasionally enlist outside help

1237
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,066
so what will it be Harry

1238
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:34,566
what do you mean by a weasel

1239
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:36,166
a about blabbering weasel

1240
00:58:36,366 --> 00:58:38,700
when weasels feel no one is watching

1241
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,100
they start acting foolishly

1242
00:58:42,841 --> 00:58:45,778
again the the moment that I see from him

1243
00:58:45,778 --> 00:58:49,908
where he breaks from like this self security 

1244
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:52,708
 is when there's a challenge to

1245
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,800
 the consistency of his character right 

1246
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,266
like

1247
00:58:55,266 --> 00:58:58,333
he doesn't like that someone is spreading something about him 

1248
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,733
he's putting on the the

1249
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:06,366
the facade that like you can go tell

1250
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:08,000
Joyce anything about me

1251
00:59:08,466 --> 00:59:10,666
right there's nothing to hide like

1252
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,266
the idea that there

1253
00:59:12,266 --> 00:59:14,866
could be a part of him that could be misinterpreted is

1254
00:59:16,408 --> 00:59:17,500
scary to him

1255
00:59:18,866 --> 00:59:21,866
just go there unlock the door and leave it open

1256
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:24,400
it's been such a burden on me Harry

1257
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,200
I just want this to be over

1258
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,066
so I can discuss business with you

1259
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:30,666
I bet you don't even know anything about the hanging

1260
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:31,966
Harry my dear friend

1261
00:59:32,266 --> 00:59:34,900
I am what people call a local bigwig

1262
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,933
I know everything that goes on in Martinaise

1263
00:59:38,266 --> 00:59:40,239
I'm refusing I'm not doing this for you fuck that

1264
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:42,400
of course Harry I understand

1265
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,066
but if that's the case

1266
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:46,333
I don't think we'll ever find your gun

1267
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,800
even worse

1268
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,700
we won't be able to speak like equals about the murder

1269
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,050
how about I come back in here once I find my gun 

1270
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:55,675
and I pointed at you 

1271
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,533
yeah that wouldn't be very cop like

1272
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:00,766
that's that's my

1273
01:00:02,325 --> 01:00:03,591
 that's my authority coming

1274
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,400
okay okay calm down

1275
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:09,500
let's let's rebalance here

1276
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,866
perhaps this was just bad timing for you

1277
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:14,466
know that you can *always* come back to me

1278
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,966
I really hope you do

1279
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:19,933
for your sake my sake and for your gun's sake too

1280
01:00:20,066 --> 01:00:22,600
yes we both understand what you meant

1281
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:25,900
this may be the only way he thinks

1282
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,500
I won't hold it against you

1283
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:31,016
in fact we probably *should* reconsider later

1284
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:37,357
so what is this telling me that Kim thinks it's okay 

1285
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:39,766
 if I go do this 

1286
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:42,800
I mean my thinking is like

1287
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,133
if I say yes to the task

1288
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:50,573
I at least get to know more about what his plans are  

1289
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:54,010
because then I can go investigate  

1290
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:56,366
and I don't have to do with this motherfucker wants 

1291
01:00:56,366 --> 01:01:00,133
but I can at least like find out his intentions

1292
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:07,533
audio from the game a little low

1293
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:10,666
let's see if I can fix that

1294
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,900
so help me out here guys

1295
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:23,766
because again my goal is to actually progress the game 

1296
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:26,533
even at the best of my own role play sometimes

1297
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,100
so it sounds like Kim is okay if we take on the task

1298
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,133
once we get there though maybe we decide to do something else 

1299
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:35,533
play both sides

1300
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:36,233
yes yes my best minute

1301
01:01:36,233 --> 01:01:37,470
yes yes my best men are

1302
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,900
 what's that Harry

1303
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,297
you're getting a little pale

1304
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:43,200
is it the words *paranoid schizophrenic*

1305
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,389
and *lost gun* in one sentence

1306
01:01:45,966 --> 01:01:47,966
don't worry it's just a lead

1307
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,730
it'll probably turn out to be nothing

1308
01:01:51,566 --> 01:01:53,525
yes yes what's that Harry

1309
01:01:53,525 --> 01:01:53,700
yes yes what's that Harry
（选择选项）我正在重新考虑你让我开门的那件事 也许这样会有所帮助

1310
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,200
you're getting a little pale

1311
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,358
a fantastic change of heart Harry

1312
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,200
go talk to Mañana down by the gates

1313
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,000
he'll brief you and give you the key

1314
01:02:02,466 --> 01:02:03,266
okay

1315
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,333
just open *one little door*

1316
01:02:05,466 --> 01:02:07,300
you don't need to go in or anything

1317
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:11,066
I just want that weasel to come home and see the unlocked door 

1318
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,787
that's it anything else we should discuss

1319
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,666
well we will be able to investigate that

1320
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:22,133
but let's return to the question about the folder firm now 

1321
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:26,983
let's hear it Harry

1322
01:02:28,576 --> 01:02:29,330
hmm

1323
01:02:30,733 --> 01:02:33,079
maybe I should ask about this it could damage me though

1324
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,100
this seems a little too desperate

1325
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:42,928
the thing is is like I do want to know this but not from him 

1326
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,466
I am self aware enough to know that

1327
01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:48,733
he will weaponize that information whether it is true or not 

1328
01:02:48,733 --> 01:02:50,300
so I am not going to ask

1329
01:02:52,733 --> 01:02:54,333
I'm not gonna ask this for now

1330
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,933
maybe I can get a point in drama or something along the way 

1331
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:58,333
and come back to it

1332
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:58,575
of course Harry of course
（选择选项）我们聊聊别的事吧

1333
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:00,333
of course Harry of course

1334
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,791
let's not linger on personal details and amnesia

1335
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:03,868
let's not linger on personal details and amnesia
好了我们走吧

1336
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:04,866
you wanted something from me

1337
01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:07,925
wait you need this to get in and out through the gate

1338
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:10,691
wait you need this to get in and out through the gate

1339
01:03:16,766 --> 01:03:19,400
great wouldn't want to get stuck in here 

1340
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,800
here you're one of us now a real red and white union man 

1341
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,963
take care Harry

1342
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:28,500
okay

1343
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,405
I have made 42 percent checks for I also lost like a

1344
01:03:33,405 --> 01:03:35,633
hey so we've been monitoring you internally 

1345
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:37,558
and now we know your *copotype*

1346
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:41,658
wait there are *copotypes* what is this

1347
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,700
what is a copotype

1348
01:03:46,766 --> 01:03:48,487
yes guess what's yours

1349
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:52,691
sorry cop

1350
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:56,766
sorry cop

1351
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:00,700
yes sorry cop

1352
01:04:00,933 --> 01:04:02,533
the cop who's sorriest

1353
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:04,966
let's make it official then shall we

1354
01:04:05,266 --> 01:04:07,866
huge lack of enthusiasm going on in here

1355
01:04:08,866 --> 01:04:10,091
what are the other copotypes

1356
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:13,766
oh you know

1357
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,339
Apocalypse Superstellar 

1358
01:04:16,339 --> 01:04:20,366
The Advanced Interesting Cop Liquid Shadow Cop 

1359
01:04:20,733 --> 01:04:22,966
but you're too sorry to say those things

1360
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,183
so here we go

1361
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:33,950
so

1362
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:38,066
I actually do think that okay

1363
01:04:38,066 --> 01:04:39,566
like I don't understand the

1364
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:42,000
internalization thing yet

1365
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,300
this is kind of only one of the

1366
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,483
third or fourth times we've encountered it

1367
01:04:47,733 --> 01:04:48,300
here's the thing

1368
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,366
I'll talk about the thought cabinet and all that stuff but like 

1369
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,166
I'll probably like wait till I'm much further in the game 

1370
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:56,500
and I've experienced a lot of it

1371
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,066
and then I'll make a whole video on it or something like 

1372
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:01,743
cause I'll say some shit that's like stupid 

1373
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:04,300
 if I start giving my interpretation now

1374
01:05:05,266 --> 01:05:07,600
other than to say that like obviously yeah

1375
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:10,400
I could talk about how thoughts

1376
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,600
start as thoughts and become core beliefs

1377
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:17,425
I could talk about schemas

1378
01:05:20,933 --> 01:05:22,377
essentially like

1379
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:27,947
every time a thought gets reinforced by something evidential 

1380
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,500
it can become a core belief over time

1381
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,866
but core beliefs can be very maladaptive

1382
01:05:34,866 --> 01:05:39,600
meaning that they can develop out of like negative experiences 

1383
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,700
and when we internalize something 

1384
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
that's very negative about ourselves 

1385
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,533
it becomes very deeply rooted

1386
01:05:44,533 --> 01:05:45,850
and we often don't even know that 

1387
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,791
it's the source of many counterproductive behaviors 

1388
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:54,566
what that turns into is a lot of like

1389
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,519
outward avoidance of inner conflicts

1390
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,967
let me know if you would like me to go on 

1391
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:04,266
a very long thorough Tangent about that 

1392
01:06:04,266 --> 01:06:08,436
or if you prefer I save it for like another time 

1393
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:15,466
the thing is is I think that my character

1394
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,933
is the sorry type

1395
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:22,216
if I'm thinking legitimately about 

1396
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:26,533
who my character is right now

1397
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:28,366
and I actually based this on like

1398
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,309
what does it look like when someone 

1399
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:36,125
finally crosses that threshold  of 

1400
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:43,070
how do I integrate who I was with who I am  

1401
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:47,716
in a way that like does not harm me right 

1402
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,348
in a way that feels like I'm making amends for those things 

1403
01:06:53,348 --> 01:06:57,100
 but not leaning more into like self destruction okay 

1404
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:02,245
and I have seen and do think that  

1405
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:05,150
a lot of apology would come through this right 

1406
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,900
because what is an apology right now to my character

1407
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:15,803
what job does this category of behaviors and emotions and thoughts 

1408
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,066
what is it about right

1409
01:07:20,066 --> 01:07:21,857
my character right now feels like 

1410
01:07:21,857 --> 01:07:23,766
I don't know enough about who I was 

1411
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:25,200
I don't know what I did

1412
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:29,391
I'm not in control of the narrative that other people have about me  

1413
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:31,066
 I don't know my own name

1414
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,466
I don't know if I have a family

1415
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,933
I don't know if I hurt those people

1416
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:35,666
I don't know if I abandoned them

1417
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:36,733
I don't know that

1418
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,266
I am alone in this world

1419
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:43,650
and if I were to find out I have a family and that I lost them 

1420
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:45,066
 it would crush me

1421
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:49,600
like there are so many things going on in my character's mind 

1422
01:07:49,933 --> 01:07:52,166
so many things he is not in control of

1423
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,633
and when we feel like that

1424
01:07:55,933 --> 01:08:00,057
the only sense of action that we can take sometimes  

1425
01:08:00,057 --> 01:08:02,133
is just a genuine apology

1426
01:08:02,266 --> 01:08:05,466
because we say to ourselves and to everyone

1427
01:08:06,733 --> 01:08:07,866
I'm sorry I

1428
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:11,573
I'm not connected to

1429
01:08:12,473 --> 01:08:14,908
 those things that I did or those things that I feel 

1430
01:08:14,908 --> 01:08:19,266
and the only way I can respond to them is 

1431
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,200
react to the emotion I have in the present

1432
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,619
which is that like I regret it 

1433
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:27,462
I regret not knowing  

1434
01:08:27,462 --> 01:08:28,400
I regret

1435
01:08:29,866 --> 01:08:33,516
not being able to give you a genuine response to this

1436
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:37,819
so yes I do think that like apology 

1437
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:40,136
being apologetic being sorry 

1438
01:08:40,136 --> 01:08:45,266
 is very fitting for the narrative of this character so far 

1439
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:47,266
from everything that I've seen of him so far

1440
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,568
there is a lot of shame in that absolutely right

1441
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:56,200
but apology it can be a double edged sword right

1442
01:08:58,066 --> 01:08:59,166
for some people

1443
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:02,400
they start to wield the apology

1444
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,469
because they get so used to telling themselves that 

1445
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:11,294
apologizing is the work for dealing with this thing I don't like 

1446
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,300
we discover that

1447
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,100
oh when I apologize it gives me that sense of control

1448
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:20,114
it gives me a small sense of ownership over the past

1449
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:24,184
and we start saying it and it loses its meaning

1450
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,766
but it needs to be apology and action

1451
01:09:27,766 --> 01:09:29,700
it needs to be apology and change

1452
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,476
it needs to be apology and reflection

1453
01:09:32,133 --> 01:09:34,975
it needs to be apology and seeking feedback

1454
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,066
I can't just tell you I'm sorry

1455
01:09:37,066 --> 01:09:39,700
I need to tell you how do I need to change

1456
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,566
it's the same words but the intention behind it is very important 

1457
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,533
so for my character to actually heal

1458
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:51,266
it cannot just be I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry 

1459
01:09:51,466 --> 01:09:52,875
absolve me please

1460
01:09:53,366 --> 01:09:55,677
it needs to be I'm sorry how can I change 

1461
01:09:55,677 --> 01:09:59,933
I'm sorry what do I need to do to be better 

1462
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,251
I'm gonna opt into this because

1463
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:07,890
 even though it's not the most comfortable thing 

1464
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:10,016
  for us to admit 

1465
01:10:10,016 --> 01:10:11,699
 it's what I feel is right 

1466
01:10:13,766 --> 01:10:15,744
of course you are it's okay  

1467
01:10:16,494 --> 01:10:20,140
see if you can get something out of this like info  

1468
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,200
or maybe every time you say you're sorry

1469
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,866
you get a million bucks

1470
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:26,375
that's exactly what I'm talking about right

1471
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:29,000
like there's a part of our mind that goes to that place 

1472
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,963
saids that says okay well 

1473
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:34,766
 what does apology do for me in a transactional sense 

1474
01:10:34,766 --> 01:10:36,466
when I say sorry to someone

1475
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:39,100
what do I get back from them

1476
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,133
do I get back from them it's okay

1477
01:10:41,566 --> 01:10:45,133
do I do I get absolved of what I did because

1478
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:48,908
if I feel like I do then

1479
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:51,500
okay well I've already gotten the reward 

1480
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,341
for apology which is absolution 

1481
01:10:55,962 --> 01:10:58,204
but if you're looking for absolution from someone else

1482
01:10:59,966 --> 01:11:02,050
you're doing sorry the wrong way

1483
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:05,791
what you really need is absolution from yourself right

1484
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:10,602
I can genuinely speak to this 

1485
01:11:10,602 --> 01:11:13,000
considering that I just uploaded like 

1486
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:15,700
what is essentially an apology video right

1487
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,051
because like I've got something seriously wrong 

1488
01:11:17,051 --> 01:11:19,566
about Kim's character and 

1489
01:11:20,933 --> 01:11:25,610
a mix of what I saw as my character's dialogue and 

1490
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:27,766
my own impressions

1491
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,500
resulted in some really bad takes

1492
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,200
and

1493
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:37,710
no one was like you need to apologize for this right

1494
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:43,882
 it was I felt I needed to say sorry to people but I also like 

1495
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:48,248
I needed to apologize because it wasn't okay with myself 

1496
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,266
right and that's what I mean by this

1497
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,609
saying sorry so that you get someone else's

1498
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:58,161
forgiveness is only half of it right you

1499
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,600
you

1500
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,400
you have to

1501
01:12:01,533 --> 01:12:05,266
you have to mean it because it it makes you feel more

1502
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:08,333
okay with yourself right like

1503
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:11,297
life is better when you live it honestly

1504
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,058
and you don't avoid even the worst parts of yourself

1505
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,989
I think and it's hard to live that way  

1506
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:20,009
because it's not always clear that 

1507
01:12:20,243 --> 01:12:22,475
 you are doing something dishonest 

1508
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,337
sorry therapist that's me I guess it is me you know

1509
01:12:30,566 --> 01:12:32,449
I think apology is really important

1510
01:12:33,034 --> 01:12:35,191
for your own self healing

1511
01:12:39,547 --> 01:12:42,779
and I think it's fitting for what we're doing in this character

1512
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,050
lets see what it says

1513
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,233
rigorous self-critique

1514
01:12:55,233 --> 01:12:55,805
okay

1515
01:12:57,266 --> 01:12:58,107
let's check this out

1516
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,266
minus authority I think that that's good

1517
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,733
I think that's legitimately good

1518
01:13:03,266 --> 01:13:04,530
all I have been talking about 

1519
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:08,100
is how our character views the world in terms of authority 

1520
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,966
and it has let to very negative consequences

1521
01:13:10,966 --> 01:13:13,798
it let to us trying to hit a child 

1522
01:13:13,798 --> 01:13:16,900
because we felt like he was emasculating us 

1523
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,600
it let us to

1524
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,620
irresponsibly shooting down the corpse 

1525
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:25,121
because we wanted to show Kim that we had it under control right  

1526
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:27,533
it let us to like

1527
01:13:27,566 --> 01:13:30,034
failing to navigate our conversation with Joyce  

1528
01:13:30,034 --> 01:13:32,166
because we fail to see that 

1529
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,093
authority in intellect is comparable or greater than authority in status right 

1530
01:13:40,066 --> 01:13:42,800
the only place that authority has won out really

1531
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,275
was with measurehead so far  

1532
01:13:45,275 --> 01:13:47,416
I consider this an anomaly

1533
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:52,125
so losing authority is good for us right now

1534
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:55,333
we do not want to see the world in terms of authority

1535
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:58,100
this is not a good way to organize our lives

1536
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,166
we can see that in Everett Clare's view of the world 

1537
01:14:04,933 --> 01:14:06,266
I like this a lot

1538
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,716
you're one sorry piece of shit

1539
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,533
a cop penitence a flagellant cop monk

1540
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,566
this is not the right line of work for you

1541
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,300
you should be graveling at the feet of a feudal lord

1542
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:23,166
providing lurid evidence against yourself at a Mazovian show trial 

1543
01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:26,666
or ripping the flesh from your back with a cat of nine tails 

1544
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,666
whatever made this way

1545
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:31,100
you can be damn sure it was *your* own fault

1546
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,800
do it *really* curious criticize yourself

1547
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:35,600
who knows you might uncover

1548
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:38,650
something of importance from your guilt ridden past

1549
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:42,955
we're absolutely going to internalize this

1550
01:14:42,955 --> 01:14:47,966
 to me this is the moment I'm looking for from character 

1551
01:14:48,766 --> 01:14:51,075
but it's also a moment I am looking for

1552
01:14:51,075 --> 01:14:53,641
 in the process of therapy right 

1553
01:14:54,807 --> 01:14:56,016
rigorous self-critique

1554
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,750
but with a backbone of empathy towards yourself

1555
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,075
let's internalize

1556
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,800
this is this is good this is good for us

1557
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,004
maybe in myself as well totally totally

1558
01:15:14,866 --> 01:15:15,933
okay Mr Claire

1559
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,133
