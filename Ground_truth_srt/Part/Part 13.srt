1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,400
hello

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,366
and welcome to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:06,933
so on today's episode

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,743
the plot signed we are going to 

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:15,546
see if we can establish our authority with Titus the union boss   

6
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:19,133
we're gonna see if we can get a little closer to a confession from him on 

7
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:23,533
who exactly was involved with the murder in Martinez

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,700
and over on the analysis side

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,140
we're gonna be taking a deep dive into the rigorous self critique thought 

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,291
 now that we've finally internalized this one  

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,500
it opens the door for a lot of discussion on

12
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,700
Harry's sense of self

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,716
and kind of digging into the question of

14
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,573
 is he actually a good person

15
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:43,790
 and if he's not 

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,100
does  he think that it's possible to become one 

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,200
this one's a little bit heavier on the analysis

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,250
这一点在分析中占比会更大

19
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:53,674
but it's pretty exciting to finally peel back more layers of our character 

20
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,400
 so let's jump in

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,866
any predictions on where the story will go or who's the killer

22
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,500
I kind of had the idea

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,566
that we would be somewhat involved in the killing like

24
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,733
that we would be somewhat involved in the killing like

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,133
because we are so uninitiated to our own past

26
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,766
I don't think that we did it like would have hung him up like that

27
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,333
but I sort of have the suspicion that

28
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,866
the dock workers are kind of like a red herring

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,100
I just don't buy it

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,733
I just don't buy it

31
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,600
that's that's what we're leading

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,500
but I could be wrong

33
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:37,066
I am notoriously bad at predicting the plot

34
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,600
of anything ever like

35
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,933
when you have already probably noticed this

36
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:46,000
but like when politics or the plot are part of the dialogue

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,733
my brain like

38
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,566
it does this it feels like

39
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,027
it condenses down to like 

40
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:54,100
I have to I've had to do this before

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
where I’m like  okay what is happening here  

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,400
my brain is just equipped for like character or an analysis

43
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,764
and the way I engage with media just privately 

44
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:04,133
 is like when I’m watching something

45
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,650
I’m not really thinking about the plot 

46
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,400
I’m very rarely like what

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
I’m not like watching shutter island

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
and I’m like where is this going

49
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,166
I wonder what's gonna happen next

50
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,459
my brain just like accepts whatever's going to happen

51
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,766
but what I’m thinking about

52
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:18,102
is like wow what is that character feeling right now  

53
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:19,430
you know 

54
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,700
I wonder how like

55
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,579
whatever is going to happen to them  

56
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,845
is going to change their worldview 

57
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,733
like it's that's more where my mind is focused 

58
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,787
and I kind of just accept the plot

59
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:33,366
 whatever it is it doesn't that matter that much to me 

60
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,733
the sequence of things happening

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,300
unless it is so egregious that I’m like this doesn't make any sense 

62
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:43,466
what if it was Lena well

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,628
I refuse to accept that 

64
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:49,415
Lena is too kind hearted and good natured 

65
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:50,966
 for her to be involved in that 

66
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:53,500
（读chat）“有趣的是 心理治疗师们似乎很抗拒做这种事

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,708
it's funny therapists often seem to struggle with things like

68
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:55,733
it's funny therapists often seem to struggle with things like

69
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,000
predicting stuff or telling if someone is lying well

70
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:01,400
it's true because like at the risk of  

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,790
like I always go on some sort of rant 

72
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,766
 at the beginning of these streams but um 

73
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,933
that's the thing is we are not detectives right

74
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,700
a therapist is not a detective

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,900
if someone comes into my uh therapy session

76
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,001
I’m always pretty upfront about the fact that like 

77
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:25,533
look my role is to help you in whatever capacity that I can right 

78
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:30,400
my philosophy on this is like if you give me good information

79
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,333
if you are honest about what you're going through

80
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,400
if you are open to challenging things

81
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,966
and the the the information that you give me about your life

82
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,000
and what you're going through is good

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,300
you will get good therapy right

84
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,100
because like I’m only

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,805
I’m gonna work off of what I receive  

86
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:51,400
if you give me bad information 

87
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:55,700
meaning that if you are dishonest if you are withholding things

88
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,133
if you lie about something

89
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,361
I’m gonna respond to that as if that's really 

90
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:04,700
you know that's honest because like 

91
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,989
I’m not there to like sort out of someone's lying to me or not  

92
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,933
I’m there to work off of their investment

93
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:16,333
like I can't work harder than them in some respects right

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,166
so if you give me good information

95
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,126
you'll get good help

96
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,366
 if you give me bad information

97
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,162
you'll get bad help 

98
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:23,266
because you could come in and say yeah

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,133
I’m doing great at my job there's nothing to talk about there

100
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,133
and you could be like failing at your job you could hate it 

101
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,666
it could be like the source of your depression

102
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,466
but if you tell me you're doing great I’m gonna be like cool let's move on 

103
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,672
I may have a suspicion down the line like 

104
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:46,400
hmm wait a second like you said earlier that your job is fine 

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
but it sounds like there are some stressful things

106
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,133
there like I might push into that at some point

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,666
but again like I’m only gonna really

108
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,290
I’m not there to like sort out what's true or not

109
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,733
I’m there to work off of what's brought in you know

110
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,500
so I guess that's why I’m not super good at detecting lies 

111
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,600
 because I’m not really looking for them

112
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,766
it takes you being honest I think

113
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,266
well sometimes I am surprised by my own predictions yes

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,333
it does happen from time to time that I get something

115
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:27,666
I have predicted like five things extremely accurately

116
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,462
in the course of like watching anime and stuff

117
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:33,900
 and everything else I just like someone said it in 

118
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:40,533
in one of the comments or something like

119
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,608
whenever I start saying like maybe 

120
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,735
you know that like just some random 

121
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,866
unhinged stuff is about to happen

122
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,966
do I have any personal idea of who the killer could be

123
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,500
who do I think did it well

124
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:59,966
look I gotta ask first if I’m asking who did it

125
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:01,933
I gotta ask who benefits okay

126
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:01,966
我要问谁是这起事件的受益者

127
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,366
I gotta ask myself

128
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:13,166
what does what does killing this man bring okay 

129
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,800
and I don't think that it was like a crime of passion

130
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,415
or it could be I don't know 

131
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,966
like I said prepare for me to get this wildly wrong 

132
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,866
this is wild speculation Brady

133
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,066
part of me wants to reject the impulse

134
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,766
that this is like a crime of passion

135
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,400
because it looks like pretty gruesome

136
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,800
and it makes me want to think well

137
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:44,895
I would only be here i f there were this murder 

138
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:49,466
 I think this is less about the murder victim 

139
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:52,466
and more about the changes to the society

140
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:57,266
that the murder will bring it will bring myself and Kim here 

141
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:00,266
lead us down some sort of path

142
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,666
I might not know enough about the guy that died to intuit something like that

143
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,966
oh I don't right like I said this is like baseless speculation 

144
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,366
just on like trying to find an interesting angle on it

145
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,866
I kind of doubt that it's any of these people

146
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,266
it's Tuesday

147
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,466
we need to interrogate the men in the union booth

148
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,933
find out what they know about the hanging in Martinez

149
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,966
it's gruesome because you didn't take it down for seven days

150
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:42,900
 that's true

151
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:42,966
确实

152
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,333
do I think disco elysium could be used as a tool for therapy sure 

153
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,566
I think anything as useful as a tool for therapy

154
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,566
in the hands of a skilled therapist

155
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,546
I work in games and 

156
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:58,900
there's been some talk about leveraging games in some form of therapy 

157
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,933
and for me at least playing

158
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:01,933
disco was an experience I connect with yeah

159
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:02,000
disco was an experience I connect with yeah

160
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:08,000
I think it would take the therapist and the gamer knowing lots of things about it 

161
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,698
yeah I mean like sometimes I recommend my clients to read a book  

162
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:22,200
I'll say here I want you to go read this book and talk about it with me 

163
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,100
because it's relevant to what you're going through

164
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,533
so I do see why in the future as games become more universal  

165
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,300
that I could be like

166
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,966
 hey you know I think this is relevant to what you're going through 

167
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:37,066
I think you should become a gamer and play disco elysium

168
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,300
so I know we already talked to these gentlemen

169
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,400
but I’m ready to give it another try

170
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:46,988
let's ask him if he did that 

171
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,066
 The Pretty Boy

172
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:52,900
You guys really love talking about that Pretty Boy

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Funny

174
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:59,166
But my partner and I have a serious matter to discuss with you

175
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,856
let's see why is there a container belt around the dead man's neck 

176
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,333
 Container belt Like we used in the harbor 

177
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,828
Because we took it

178
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:14,583
 from the harbor where we work

179
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,466
then we went out back and used it to hang him

180
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,466
oh did he just admit to the crime

181
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:22,866
as he speaks

182
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:28,321
his fist contract going through the pulling motion again savoring it 

183
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,617
 what did he just did he  just did he admit to the crime

184
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:39,400
 We did this together All of us until he was dead 

185
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,066
that's why there's a container belt around his neck 

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,257
okay that's it the game's over we got the perpetrator

187
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,261
 we got to wrap it up 

188
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:54,605
no you don't what you have is seven honest men

189
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,566
  who thought it forthcoming to tell you what happened 

190
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,400
so that you don't waste any more of your time

191
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,700
they're plain to their considerable strength in numbers

192
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,700
don't talk about arresting them

193
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:10,300
you only bring attention to your inability to do so

194
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,910
okay authority I’m going to listen to you this time

195
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,933
okay authority I’m going to listen to you this time

196
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,066
so what they just

197
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,766
they just confessed I guess they did it

198
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,681
who called the shots that night 

199
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:29,466
 that's what I want to know

200
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,066
there will be no singling anyone out

201
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,589
you can't arrest a hardy boy

202
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,375
 without arresting all hardy boys 

203
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,586
well  fuck I want to arrest them all then 

204
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:43,133
 do you think you could arrest them all

205
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,566
kim's got my back

206
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:47,006
Titus keep addressing him 

207
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,729
he wants everyone to know he's in charge  

208
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:52,564
fucking okay authorities got my back as well

209
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:56,766
 look they may have one two three four five six seven  

210
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:59,466
plus eight individuals here

211
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:04,846
but I've got like several mental health problem voices  

212
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,028
more than that 

213
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:08,800
who are here to back me up

214
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,200
let's do it let's address him

215
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,562
let's play along

216
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,566
who do you fucking think does

217
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,266
bows of the bearded man

218
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:37,200
you do you give the commands

219
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:41,200
he wants everyone to know he's in charge so let's play along

220
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,258
that's right asshole

221
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:48,533
 Titus hardy runs the hardy boys ain't that so fellas 

222
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,333
I think you got your answer Mr Law 

223
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,330
so he's not the leader

224
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,966
no you did not get an answer Titus does administrative work

225
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:04,307
he pushes paper fills out forms 

226
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,700
the others can't read

227
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,200
but on that night they all acted as one man 

228
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,000
that's just some fucking psychological bullshit this

229
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,600
isn't that like

230
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,900
wasn't that like part of the defense of the fucking Manson people 

231
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,500
where it's like oh well

232
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,400
he didn't he didn't commit the crimes himself

233
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,366
he just radicalized a bunch of people to do it for him

234
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,366
I did spin kicked measurehead I did we did do that

235
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,700
let's ask why that they killed him

236
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,766
why because he was worthless mercenary scum

237
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,476
and he stepped out of line in my town

238
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:58,800
 who are you covering up for

239
00:12:58,966 --> 00:12:59,935
that's what I want to know

240
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:01,340
 so he was a mercenary that's it 

241
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,827
 and he stepped out of line

242
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:06,700
 what kind of mercenary

243
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:07,978
get them Kim

244
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:11,100
 the kind that shows up when you start a strike

245
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,064
the *experienced* kind too 

246
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:17,666
had Co HoI and Seminee written all over him 

247
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,766
ex-Oranese Special Forces

248
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,766
a live grenade right here in *our* bar

249
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,232
this one has a special gripe with him coming here

250
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:33,566
 I can't prove it 

251
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,384
but I *know* he was sent by the Wild Pines

252
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,141
 they hired merk-shit like that 

253
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:44,766
 story of every strike from here to Samara 

254
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:51,366
so these guys think that wild pines got someone in here to

255
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,500
rile people up

256
00:13:58,733 --> 00:13:59,533
I guess

257
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,239
how do you know that he was in special forces

258
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:09,000
 Cause one night he walked straight up to the mic and said 

259
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,266
I’m Oranjese goddamn special forces

260
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,319
and I’m gonna fuck you all 

261
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,166
 game volume needs some

262
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:19,866
adjustment okay

263
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:20,666
let's do that

264
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,733
let me know how that is

265
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,287
uh I sincerely doubt that happened

266
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:40,366
 yeah really had a gin and tonic up there 

267
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,868
sang some Oranjese paratrooper song 

268
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,791
and said he's gonna fuck everyone 

269
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,266
 we couldn't believe it either

270
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,966
but he fucking did right there like some kind of animal

271
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,700
but what did he actually do

272
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:54,733
"但他到底做*错*了什么"

273
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:59,525
he harassed women raped one harassed workers

274
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,866
 threatened to kill some as a warning 

275
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,566
there's a slight unease in him suddenly

276
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,809
he regrets mentioning the rape

277
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,100
 to kill us all if we don't open the gates 

278
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:18,247
if we don't let the scabs in if we don't bend over  

279
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:21,700
that was *before* he started coming here

280
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,893
yeah he said it was his 'favorite joint' now 

281
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,951
started to come in here every night   

282
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:33,750
drinking grabbing girls grab one of ours mid-karaoke 

283
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,700
 right there on the stage

284
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,200
I wonder why

285
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,896
I'll save it I'll save my critique after

286
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,133
 He grabbed someone

287
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,178
the lieutenant is trying to make sense of this float of information 

288
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:51,617
yeah this girl's on the mic a beautiful girl young  

289
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,991
gets into the second verse of love of lake 

290
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:56,654
the fuck a grebsal legs start screaming

291
00:15:57,932 --> 00:15:59,166
show me your cunt

292
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,855
why don't you show me your cunt

293
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,266
 then gets knocked on the head with a wine bottle

294
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,100
doesn't even fall down

295
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:13,666
i think we're gonna have to ask if this was the same individual

296
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,766
aren't you fucking listening

297
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,333
my man is talking to you

298
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,285
he took *care* of it 

299
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:24,086
they got the girl out before anything else could happen

300
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,147
yeah me and Eugene got her out

301
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,333
aren't you fucking listening

302
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:33,566
okay

303
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,766
that's a very serious allegation

304
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,740
i want to know who they're talking about

305
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,700
no

306
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
you're not getting a name

307
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,935
that's a Martinaise matter and I'm not discussing it with you clowns

308
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:49,647
Despite the stonewalling you can slip one more question in

309
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,766
okay volition

310
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,566
let's push further into that because that seems like

311
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,300
I don't know

312
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:04,277
seems like a serious allegation to me

313
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:06,733
Titus do *not* answer

314
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,565
you have been forthcoming enough

315
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,000
fuck off cop

316
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
she's gone through enough without you harassing her too

317
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,933
she doesn't need more embarrassment

318
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,766
what are you talking about embarrassment

319
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:21,704
if someone has been sexually assaulted we need to 

320
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:26,400
what you *need* is to get the fuck out of my face

321
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,352
i've had enough of explaining myself to you fucks

322
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:32,466
he's dead

323
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,298
it's done

324
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,066
 as you can see

325
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,354
these men can only take so much baseless scrutiny

326
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:39,933
baseless

327
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,133
I do my best to keep the situation simple

328
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,741
but

329
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:46,800
all of my scrutiny is based okay

330
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,700
it is not baseless

331
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:51,132
it won't be for long she means 

332
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:54,800
 it's true she was the only thing holding him back

333
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,066
okay

334
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,660
you murdered him just like that no remorse 

335
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,000
 how many people have you sent to the *chaise*

336
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,733
ever felt remorse for them

337
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,423
or send them to Reunion to *rot*

338
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,066
for twenty years for *life*

339
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,740
look I'm just doing my job

340
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,133
what we do is *different*

341
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,479
we enforce the law you just kill people like it's nothing  

342
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,400
honestly I drink so much I can't really remember anyone  

343
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,366
let's see my character okay

344
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:34,200
like some of the stuff that we've been talking about for Harry is  

345
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,643
how he views the world right

346
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,400
so much of it so far has been in terms of authority 

347
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,088
and if I just go off of things we've said before

348
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:49,333
we were like well why can't we arrest those kids 

349
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,500
why can't we arrest Evrart Claire 

350
00:18:54,066 --> 00:19:00,666
he seems to have a very simple view of like the power dynamic

351
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,532
and I think that that's coming from the fact that

352
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,600
 he doesn't really remember who he was as a cop 

353
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,700
like imagine you just woke up and you knew you were a cop

354
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,461
but this is like still new to you

355
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:17,800
you are there are some like ingrained things you know 

356
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,900
some of your repressed memory is coming back

357
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,111
but I imagined him to be someone who is like

358
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,666
like if you made me a cop today

359
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,366
some of my questions would be like well

360
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,418
why can't we just arrest them 

361
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:29,733
right

362
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
but that's because I haven't lived as a cop

363
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,766
it's a complex thing right

364
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,733
so what I'm wondering here is like

365
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,500
harry is learning that the world does not work like that okay

366
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,857
we cannot just be an authority figure just because we have the badge 

367
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,466
we've tried that a couple of times

368
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,866
 but what would we stand on would we stand on the morality 

369
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,484
like that because we have the badge

370
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,800
 we get to decide who is good or bad  

371
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,139
we're just doing our job

372
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,700
we're neutral

373
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,766
that's a pretty neutral thing to say I like neutrality

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,800
what we do is *different* we enforce the law

375
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,266
so like these sound like strongly held convictions

376
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,800
which I don't think we have very many of at the moment

377
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,600
what do I think he would sympathize with

378
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,704
these men have all come to me and said

379
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:41,366
based on principle we don't need cops 

380
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,766
we are able to decide what's right and wrong in our community

381
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:51,200
and so he may be more sympathetic to the community aspect 

382
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,800
he's gonna say yeah but this guy was bad 

383
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,500
I don't even really believe this

384
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,009
it's not like they killed him like it was nothing

385
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:11,066
clearly there maybe was a crime of passion in some ways

386
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,386
I'm just gonna go with the

387
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:15,500
we don't have our badge now 

388
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:22,166
being a cop is a conviction yeah it is

389
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,400
but he's he's very inconfident about himself as a cop right

390
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:31,066
I just did like my whole

391
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,566
analytical piece on how

392
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,621
he's not sure what kind of cop he is right

393
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:42,266
this part right here

394
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,901
he's not sure what kind of cop he is 

395
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:50,000
and so

396
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,266
to me it doesn't make sense that he be like but I'm the kind of cop who 

397
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:02,266
I have a strong conviction about what my role is

398
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm just gonna go neutral here

399
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,366
it's gonna piss people off but I'm gonna go for it

400
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:09,813
oh so you're just a simple well-meaning man huh

401
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:11,633
ever been in solitary

402
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,200
prison is a *torture*

403
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,533
that's what it is

404
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:19,560
he's clearly been in solitary confinement

405
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,333
and at a young age nonetheless 

406
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,866
so is hanging a man slowly without breaking his neck

407
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,133
I'm so pissed

408
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,100
well like I told you I

409
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,666
I'm doing what I think a character would do

410
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:40,959
*how* did you

411
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:45,989
we hanged him up by his neck until he got real still 

412
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:49,366
 wasn't that obvious copper

413
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,666
didn't they teach you *anything* at the cop school idiot

414
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,900
you're pretty sure

415
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,533
you've had at least two years of *cop school*

416
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,411
and many more of active service

417
00:22:59,411 --> 00:22:59,900
that's right

418
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,832
that's right authority

419
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,382
certainly enough to not put up with his back-sass

420
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,302
deliver a knock-down observation

421
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,058
now *you* listen to *me* Sonny-Jim

422
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:10,246
the autopsy showed the victim's hands weren't tied

423
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:11,200
no sign of struggle 

424
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,933
explain this and make it real simple

425
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,467
fuck it I'm going with it we

426
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,430
uh we huh

427
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,166
look i'm not gonna play Twenty Questions with you coppo

428
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,610
I'll say it again killed him

429
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,366
do I think he's a neutral man no

430
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,866
but I think that he is

431
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,983
while he's still figuring out the difference between 

432
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:41,133
who he is now and who he used to be  

433
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,766
like there is an investment in integrating these two things

434
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,300
at least from my perspective

435
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:51,353
it's very hard for him to start standing on very hard held beliefs

436
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:58,766
they may and be incompatible with like who he used to be right

437
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,500
I'll talk about this in a second

438
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,000
but it comes down to ego defense

439
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,500
yeah *I* knocked him out

440
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,500
came up behind him and clubbed him in the back of the head

441
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:17,067
he went down like a sack of sand

442
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,866
that's right lawman

443
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,127
and then we hanged the fuck

444
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,047
oh

445
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,866
we did level up our composure

446
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,000
when we were talking to Annette

447
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,600
still not enough here maybe we can ask some more questions

448
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,112
Mr Tatts what did you use to knock the victim out  

449
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,566
my fucking elbow copper

450
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,431
Samaran boxing-style

451
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:45,799
where did this take place

452
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,735
right fucking here

453
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,533
Eugene already told you that

454
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:51,533
the fuck had started coming to *our* bar

455
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,163
yeah man weren't you listening

456
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,600
they keep speaking for Titus 

457
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,166
so that he wouldn't get his hands murdy with too much explaining 

458
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,429
it's a red check it can't be retried

459
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:11,400
58 percent

460
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,933
maybe I can ask some more questions

461
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,340
first

462
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,876
like what copper

463
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:27,933
when did this happen

464
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,887
you don't have to keep answering his questions

465
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:31,740
yes you do I'm a cop

466
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,133
I know Lizzy relax 

467
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,202
we killed him last Sunday night

468
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:38,900
seemed like a good way to end the week 

469
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,098
how long had you known him

470
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:41,917
*known* him

471
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,606
we don't associate with scum like that asshole

472
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,766
look I'm getting science that

473
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:50,500
the chat is hitting me with lucky tomatoes

474
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,456
so

475
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,800
yeah who do you think we are 

476
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,275
"I have gloves for composure" do it?

477
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,466
I can't look at my interventory

478
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,266
I'll back out of this conversation and check

479
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:02,800
quiet 

480
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:05,825
he came around 'bout three weeks ago

481
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,308
when that *Pines* cow first sailed into town

482
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,643
happy

483
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:13,108
by the 'Pines cow' you mean Joyce Messier 

484
00:26:13,408 --> 00:26:15,475
the representative for Wild Pines

485
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,972
the same company you're striking against 

486
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:18,900
no

487
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,666
I mean *the Pines cow*

488
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,333
the stupid-ass cow they sent in to fuck us over

489
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,333
but you know what

490
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:31,166
he rubs his chin pretending to mull it over

491
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,966
why don't you ask *her* about the Pretty Boy

492
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,633
I'm sure she has interesting things to say

493
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:36,900
 when you ask her *hard* enough

494
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,266
that's enough insinuation for today Titus

495
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,666
officer your interview is drawing to an end

496
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:47,333
don't waste your last questions

497
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:53,966
uh yeah I don't think I can back out of this 

498
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,300
and I don't remember

499
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,566
I think we checked our inventory

500
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:59,166
and we're wearing everything that we can for composure already

501
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:02,628
so I have to do the check now

502
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,500
why don't you ask *her* about the Pretty Boy

503
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,825
that's enough insinuation for today Titus

504
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,733
how do I get back to that one

505
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:17,966
which one was it

506
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,766
was it "*how* did you kill him

507
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:28,855
yes

508
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,333
all right

509
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,700
let's get this fire started okay

510
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,266
we need some fucking tomatoes in the chat right now

511
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,366
to get our dice roll

512
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:46,700
look there's a secret edition that happens to the dice roll 

513
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,100
when chat is full of lucky tomatoes

514
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,700
okay

515
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,650
I'm seeing a lot of them flow through right now

516
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,169
 the other thing is look I'm sizing this guy up all right

517
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,065
 it takes a lot of responsibility 

518
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,466
and a lot of conviction to stand before me 

519
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:04,267
with my flashlight and my cool hat

520
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,500
 jacket shoes and Kim beside me 

521
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:08,175
right

522
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,566
and to back all these guys up okay

523
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,763
now look that's a...

524
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:16,137
whether or not we agree at something that I can respect

525
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:19,000
is that he's putting himself out there like this 

526
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,333
but I can also tell that he's nervous okay

527
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,866
nobody likes being questioned on their morals

528
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,933
nobody likes being questioned on their convictions

529
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:36,875
and nobody likes to also be targeted by authority figures 

530
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,466
okay so I got a lot of respect for this guy

531
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:43,000
just from a very primal sort of way now

532
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,333
I do not have respect for his actions or his beliefs

533
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,400
flashlight gives us the extra composure I think it does

534
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:58,881
but let's see if we can break him down okay

535
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,315
I'm fucking going for it

536
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:06,375
actually they're admirably surprisingly composed

537
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,066
the entire room

538
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,900
given how many questions you've lobbed their way

539
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:15,102
all of them maybe one of them is fidgeting

540
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:16,533
well this one

541
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,450
but he's always fidgeting

542
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:19,890
so don't get your hopes up

543
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,824
 we're too fucked

544
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,566
we're too fucked up to

545
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,424
I thought that we had an understanding 

546
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,983
what I was getting at is we 

547
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:32,733
it takes a lot of pressure for me to stand here

548
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,933
and for you to stand here and to do this whole rigmarole 

549
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:36,566
let's connect on just the fact that

550
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,133
no one wants to be here right now

551
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,733
but it didn't work

552
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:41,066
 like what copper

553
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:43,533
okay what are we gonna do now

554
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,301
nothing

555
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:46,932
your investigation here is done

556
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:48,656
leave Martinaise

557
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,910
go back to your stations where you belong 

558
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:53,933
 every check that I talk about a lot fails

559
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:54,725
I know it does 

560
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:57,366
and every time I just make a check without thinking about it 

561
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:59,100
it's a succeed

562
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,866
that's true it's so true

563
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,150
I think we are going to stick around thanks 

564
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,845
 some things don't add up here Titus 

565
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:09,505
 fuck 

566
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:10,940
I've done this job for long enough 

567
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,200
to know that people don't just confess to first-degree murder 

568
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:16,766
*even* if it is a group responsibility

569
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,533
we are going to look into this

570
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:19,737
it's all a cover up

571
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:20,866
 good luck with that

572
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,600
who are you protecting

573
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,166
you've heard everything a *rent-a-cop* is gonna hear from us *real* law officials 

574
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:29,933
you're lucky you didn't get a beating

575
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,066
who are you protecting right now

576
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,933
okay who's really benefiting from this

577
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:34,825
is it Claire

578
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:35,600
 is it Evrart

579
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:37,850
rent-a-cop

580
00:30:38,124 --> 00:30:39,800
so that's what this is about

581
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,827
he doesn't see you as his equals

582
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,371
 establish authority 

583
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,641
we have to we have to do it

584
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,041
I fuck this absolutely fuck this

585
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:51,910
 so I'm not even gonna talk about I’m just gonna do it 

586
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,500
 establish authority yes

587
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,916
AUTHORITY

588
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,066
 feverish thoughts race through your mind

589
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,800
damn it

590
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:08,125
let's just stomp our feet

591
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,700
 we could point at him

592
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:14,266
we could point at him

593
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:16,333
or we could ask for the gun

594
00:31:22,568 --> 00:31:23,951
hum that's it that's all I got  

595
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:24,736
look 

596
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:27,600
the only thing that we have been able to do so far 

597
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,100
is embarrass ourselves

598
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:33,166
I'm not gonna stomp my feet

599
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,966
I do like the idea of pointing my finger at him

600
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm gonna point my finger

601
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,400
 and what exactly is it you've been doing

602
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,886
that's so god damn special

603
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:49,900
 shitting yourself in front of us

604
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,766
going around arresting kids on the street

605
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,800
kids who've done nothing wrong

606
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:58,468
you don't know that

607
00:31:58,468 --> 00:32:00,300
 all the while talking racist shit

608
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,548
don't think we aren't watching *fascha*

609
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,366
 people here trust us

610
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:06,375
we're getting *complaints*

611
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,225
I

612
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:13,539
uh I don't even have a gun

613
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,725
 what are you talking about

614
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,273
 guns are the only thing you have 

615
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:20,925
 waving them around old ladies' faces

616
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:22,566
 trying a gun down kid 

617
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,266
he knows about Cuno

618
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,933
Carly said they've been trying to set up a mass execution

619
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,500
bulk-purchasing guns ammunition too 

620
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:36,213
 I can believe that

621
00:32:36,463 --> 00:32:38,466
 Carly works in a gunshop you see

622
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,866
there's no mass-execution officer

623
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,466
just ask questions and don't get sidetracked

624
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,925
okay I need Kim to rein me in here

625
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:47,200
please don't set up a mass execution

626
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
you'll never be able to pull it off

627
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:51,600
the logistics alone are insane

628
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,296
 just ask questions

629
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,488
 be a normal cop

630
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,733
I can't

631
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:56,511
I've tried

632
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:57,666
 I cannot be a normal cop

633
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,300
fuck okay

634
00:33:05,662 --> 00:33:07,727
the only time I don't get Kim involved by now 

635
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:09,687
RIGOROUS SELF - CRITIQUE

636
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:14,428
here it is 

637
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,688
Hard facts from the man you are

638
00:33:17,387 --> 00:33:19,891
You once jerked off in the locker room

639
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:20,657
and were caught

640
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,433
you held a young woman by the arm  

641
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:28,194
and kept her in your apartment for 20 minutes against her will 

642
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,785
 That's right

643
00:33:29,785 --> 00:33:32,062
these are not flights of fancy

644
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:35,128
These are*real deeds* harry

645
00:33:35,128 --> 00:33:37,628
emerging from the darkness of your past

646
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:41,228
you tried shooting a fleeing suspect in the foot

647
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,995
but hit him in the pelvis crippling him for life

648
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:45,288
and above all you let life defeat you

649
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:46,120
and above all you let life defeat you
我的妈呀

650
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,454
and above all you let life defeat you

651
00:33:48,642 --> 00:33:50,817
All the gifts your parents gave you

652
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:53,962
all the love and patience of your friends

653
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:56,262
you drowned in a neurotoxin

654
00:33:56,762 --> 00:33:58,195
you let misery win

655
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,428
and it will keep on winning

656
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:03,139
till you die or overcome it

657
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:05,893
 holy shit

658
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:16,028
that is the most important block of text for this entire playthrough in my mind 

659
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,662
and I will tell you why

660
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:31,195
okay

661
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:34,426
what do we get from this first of all

662
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:44,695
 intelligence and chology checks red check failures here or plus one morale

663
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:52,082
physical and motorix red check failurse here one health

664
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:55,658
learning cap for pain threshold is raised okay

665
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,517
okay interesting  

666
00:34:58,298 --> 00:35:01,195
so we actually get things back from failing

667
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:03,362
which is kind of unique

668
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,037
yeah there is a reason that harry did his best to forget everything

669
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:14,703
that's exactly what I suspected

670
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:20,447
and I want to tell you about what this would mean to me in the context of like 

671
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:25,237
someone learning more about like a part of their life

672
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:28,786
that they previously were not attached to

673
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:31,737
so I'm gonna bring it back to my

674
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,530
discussion points about

675
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,657
like this is what we talked about last time

676
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:43,537
we were not sure if we were a good cop

677
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:45,103
this is unknown to us right

678
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:47,913
and it's not like super known to everyone around us

679
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:50,737
obviously it's gonna be known to any of the people we

680
00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:53,603
interacted with in our past life

681
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:56,803
but this being here in the unknown

682
00:35:56,803 --> 00:36:02,544
is one of the only reasons that any other movement can take place for us

683
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:05,737
we've been very concerned about like

684
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,437
is it even possible to repair ourselves

685
00:36:09,437 --> 00:36:11,837
is it even possible to become a better person

686
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,370
because at the end of the day

687
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,955
let's say I live my life in service of good deeds

688
00:36:18,037 --> 00:36:20,137
what happens if everything I did before

689
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,403
this was still horrific right

690
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:25,537
am I going to be okay with myself

691
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:31,170
our view of ourself has been changing in a somewhat positive direction 

692
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,570
and we've been questioning whether

693
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,437
or not we can call ourselves a complete failure

694
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,608
so one thing that just changed is we discovered that

695
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:44,190
no we weren't a good cop right 

696
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,291
we were not one  

697
00:36:46,695 --> 00:36:48,170
this is coming over here

698
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:52,103
right

699
00:36:57,237 --> 00:37:02,280
we were not a good cop

700
00:37:03,837 --> 00:37:07,803
and in fact we may not have been a good person right

701
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:15,009
and I think that those two things are intermixed because like 

702
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,744
 being a cop being someone who is responsible for other people   

703
00:37:18,744 --> 00:37:20,981
responsible for keeping the law keeping the peace  

704
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:24,570
our actions and our deeds in that role they

705
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:30,970
they do sort of like they are married in a way

706
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,056
with our views of ourselves 

707
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:35,159
like if we abused our power if we

708
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:40,233
did things that we would call inappropriate like you know

709
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,969
shooting at a fleeing suspect  

710
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,903
and holding someone against their will

711
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:49,727
right

712
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:51,770
 not only are we not a good cop

713
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,770
we don't feel like we it's possible for us to be a good person

714
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:02,503
unfortunately the more we tried to obscure this right

715
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:03,703
I think it's been like

716
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:08,237
Inland Empire Volition some of Half Light 

717
00:38:08,237 --> 00:38:13,273
there's been all these voices who have been like protecting us in a way  

718
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:14,370
from discovering this

719
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:19,737
because they they are interjecting at points to say like well

720
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:21,737
if you discover more about yourself

721
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:23,737
you're gonna realize that you weren't a good cop

722
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:26,137
and you're not gonna feel very much like a good person either

723
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,570
and that's gonna wreck you

724
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:32,203
at the same time I think it is healthier 

725
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:35,403
not to deny these things anymore  and to 

726
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:43,378
I think it would be somewhat aimless to just try to be a good person generally

727
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:47,103
because therapy and mental health

728
00:38:47,837 --> 00:38:50,310
it's not just random what you do 

729
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,137
in some ways you need clear objectives right 

730
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:57,737
we need to know when we're starting off

731
00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:59,970
like what are we trying to actually work on here

732
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,526
because if we're just trying to work on like being good

733
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,114
this is like too abstract it's too broad  

734
00:39:06,114 --> 00:39:08,803
it touches too many areas of life right 

735
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,348
we want to get things more concretely and say like well 

736
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:17,519
I want I don't want people to be afraid of me okay well that's

737
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:22,137
that's something that a good person would do right

738
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:30,003
we're trying to come up with more concrete things

739
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:33,994
and so learning these specific points would be very beneficial to that

740
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:37,337
 here's the facts from the man that you are right

741
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:40,307
you jerked off in the locker room and were caught

742
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,133
 so to me that says like

743
00:39:44,803 --> 00:39:49,903
there's this kind of selfishness to that there is a

744
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:56,770
lack of self-respect

745
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:03,137
there is a lack of impulse control

746
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,203
there is

747
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,537
lots of like

748
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,461
lots of shame wrapped up in that right

749
00:40:20,937 --> 00:40:22,682
you held a young woman by the arm 

750
00:40:22,682 --> 00:40:26,899
and kept her in your apartment for twenty minutes against your will  

751
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:30,303
so similar things here but also

752
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:36,003
we can we have the capacity to be authoritative

753
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:46,137
we are seeing from ourselves that we are controlling

754
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:51,437
that we're imposing

755
00:40:57,113 --> 00:40:58,570
we lack empathy

756
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:02,603
right

757
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,720
these not flights of fancy thses are real deeds

758
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,970
emerging from the darkness from your past

759
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,165
you tried shooting a fleeing suspect in the foot

760
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:16,303
but hid him in the pelvis crippling him for life so

761
00:41:18,903 --> 00:41:22,037
I think that's like lacking composure right

762
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:27,737
we were probably drunk let's be honest right um

763
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:34,555
these don't even have to be emotional things 

764
00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:41,120
this could just be like we had we have poor accuracy right 

765
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,837
we we have poor accountability

766
00:41:48,618 --> 00:41:49,258
right

767
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,503
we we lack

768
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,737
yeah we lack accountability and I think that we also like

769
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:08,637
see if you shot someone and crippled him

770
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:11,903
I mean there's lots of regrets in that it sounds like

771
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:16,175
all the gifts your parents gave you  

772
00:42:16,175 --> 00:42:18,837
and love and patience of your friends

773
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:20,537
you drowned in a neurotoxin

774
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:21,637
you let misery win

775
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:23,603
so its similar things

776
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:25,694
its selfishness its lack of self respect

777
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:29,337
it's lack of impulse control it's a lack of empathy right

778
00:42:29,337 --> 00:42:34,107
it's circulating around all of these subjects 

779
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,406
and it will keep winning until you die or overcome it

780
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,423
so like

781
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:44,191
these are more concrete things to work on with someone than just like

782
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:49,337
I want to be a good person right

783
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:54,537
because I don't know what to do with that if you come to me

784
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:58,203
and say that that's our objective like I want to be a good person 

785
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:01,403
I don't want to keep repeating the same mistakes

786
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:04,437
then I'm going to ask okay well what were some of those mistakes

787
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:08,654
and so having someone discover the list of things that we just did

788
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:13,570
 and knowing that there are going to be patterns in probably other areas of their life

789
00:43:14,345 --> 00:43:18,148
we can now start to formulate an idea of 

790
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:20,437
all right well let's attack these things right 

791
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:27,755
what are some ways that like we can start living in service of not being selfish 

792
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:30,703
and learning to up put other people first

793
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:35,203
what are some things that we can do to regain some self-respect

794
00:43:35,303 --> 00:43:37,950
for example not embarrassing ourselves 

795
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,170
every time that we get into conversation with someone

796
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,737
caring more about our appearance

797
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:45,687
caring more about the language we use 

798
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:50,403
and and whether or not we approach people using authority 

799
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:52,031
like we just tried to do right

800
00:43:52,947 --> 00:43:54,170
 lack of impulse control

801
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,803
that's like a behavioral intervention that we can start working on 

802
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,103
we can start processing like elements of shame

803
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:03,303
which is kind of what we did over here

804
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:11,337
these give us clear measurable objectives to actually work on

805
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:15,437
so in the process of working with someone like harry

806
00:44:15,437 --> 00:44:20,370
this would be a huge moment of self discovery it will

807
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:24,703
be upsetting to learn these things

808
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,134
as it naturally should be like 

809
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,770
part of him wants to forget all of this stuff 

810
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,937
and just be a blank slate

811
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:32,770
that can you know be reshaped into something new

812
00:44:34,903 --> 00:44:39,629
but a lot of the work in becoming more self aware 

813
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:45,003
has to do with recognizing your ego defenses

814
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:49,853
these are very common defense

815
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,170
we use to protect ourselves from

816
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:57,537
learning the complicated things that exist in our unconscious

817
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:02,837
I'll just draw Freud's like iceberg thing here right

818
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:09,551
Freud said that a lot of our thoughts are unconscious

819
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:14,603
and that's been maintained by more than just Freud

820
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,437
but the iceberg analogy works for this right

821
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:20,552
and Harry has not like

822
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:24,303
just because he lost his memories does not mean that he has no

823
00:45:25,003 --> 00:45:27,237
that some of his unconscious thoughts

824
00:45:27,237 --> 00:45:30,837
and behaviors are not going to surface constantly right

825
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:35,737
I think there were some questions and some of the chat or comments 

826
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:37,703
I forget where they were asking like well

827
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:40,171
why would he still have an addiction 

828
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,570
if he just woke up and didn't have his memories well 

829
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,337
because like whether or not he has conscious awareness of them 

830
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:48,537
his thoughts and behaviors

831
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:54,103
they are still chemically and psychologically bound to his actions right 

832
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,487
even if he says oh yeah I really don't want to smoke like  

833
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,437
he might be going through nicotine withdrawal anyways 

834
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,476
and that's going to dictate a lot of his behavior 

835
00:46:02,136 --> 00:46:06,637
he may tell himself look I don't want to be authoritative  

836
00:46:06,637 --> 00:46:09,503
I don't want to be selfish I don't want to be any of these things 

837
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:13,928
but simply because you have that thought does not mean that this 

838
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:16,937
suddenly follows suit right there's

839
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:20,435
there's a certain amount of this that like 

840
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:23,588
the work that you have to do is how do you translate things this way 

841
00:46:23,803 --> 00:46:27,403
how do you make something that is unconscious conscious 

842
00:46:29,437 --> 00:46:30,737
and that's what we've been trying to do

843
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:34,103
as we explore our past and explore our

844
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:38,477
our good and wrong deeds 

845
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:44,490
but this line right here is very treacherous to cross 

846
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,103
for someone who is like Harry

847
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,170
who may be afraid of what he used to be right 

848
00:46:50,403 --> 00:46:55,237
and so a lot of times as we are trying to bring things up this way 

849
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:58,637
our ego defenses they get in the way of that

850
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:01,237
and they try to send them back down right

851
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:06,637
because the the ego is basically like

852
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:13,170
it's called the reality principle right

853
00:47:13,637 --> 00:47:17,103
id is like your pleasure principle

854
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:20,503
it's like dealing with all the primal desires and those sorts of things 

855
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:21,703
and the super ego is like

856
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:26,370
where your sense of morality and bigger ideas live

857
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,747
and the ego sort of moderates these things 

858
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:34,503
and translates both of the extremes down to reality

859
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:34,953
所以当我们面对那些不好的事情

860
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:38,803
and so it gets protective when

861
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,037
we face things like hey you used to not be a good person right 

862
00:47:45,037 --> 00:47:49,203
oh no my super ego is now challenged by that right 

863
00:47:49,537 --> 00:47:52,953
like hey you just learned that you were a fucking asshole 

864
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,770
and that you did all kinds of horrible things to people 

865
00:47:57,203 --> 00:48:01,403
this has the power to shatter your self image

866
00:48:01,537 --> 00:48:04,337
and so the ego tries to moderate that by

867
00:48:07,037 --> 00:48:10,592
either keeping things like kind of where they are or interpreting them 

868
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:11,912
so let me give you an example of that 

869
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:16,137
so common ego defense right

870
00:48:18,403 --> 00:48:22,203
so like here's the thing right what we don't like 

871
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:34,537
when things don't agree right

872
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,437
we do not like to see our behaviors

873
00:48:38,837 --> 00:48:41,637
disagree with one in one another so for example

874
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:49,637
let's say you look around at my apartment right

875
00:48:50,403 --> 00:48:53,937
and you saw that things were neatly set up right

876
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:57,203
like there's the environments kind of clean

877
00:48:57,737 --> 00:49:01,049
there's not like dishes in the sink 

878
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:04,803
there's not a bunch of like I don't know cat toys lying around 

879
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,203
like it's neatly put together

880
00:49:06,203 --> 00:49:09,803
and it's organized and it's well taken care of right

881
00:49:11,403 --> 00:49:13,337
but then let's say you got in my car

882
00:49:13,337 --> 00:49:15,903
and you discovered that there's like Gatorade bottles on the floor 

883
00:49:15,903 --> 00:49:18,103
and an expired air freshener and 

884
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:22,995
old receipts that I haven't taken out right

885
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:26,203
and you would look at that and say like well

886
00:49:26,937 --> 00:49:31,302
like why why could this happen  

887
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,770
because we see this all the time right

888
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,837
I have seen this from people

889
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:38,687
and sometimes I see it in you know my own behavior

890
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:41,403
not specifically this my car is pretty clean right now 

891
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,357
but like sometimes we see that 

892
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:47,803
where one part of someone's life looks super put together 

893
00:49:47,803 --> 00:49:49,711
and another one doesn't 

894
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:51,903
and you might start asking the question of why 

895
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:54,261
why would this happen

896
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:58,562
why would you walk into my house and see that it's put together

897
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,152
and then you go into my car and  it's a fucking mess 

898
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:03,829
let me ask what your read on that is

899
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:06,503
what do you think is going on there

900
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,237
because it has to do with all of this

901
00:50:16,103 --> 00:50:17,837
there's a million rats in the walls yeah

902
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,837
me at work versus day to day yeah

903
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:27,337
could be it could be

904
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,537
I've seen many people like that in real life maybe it's OCD yeah

905
00:50:33,903 --> 00:50:34,937
this is this is good right

906
00:50:34,937 --> 00:50:38,037
we're looking for like what explains this what explains 

907
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:41,599
two behaviors that don't actually agree with each other 

908
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,970
one area of my life is super pristine and put together

909
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,503
and another one is like kind of a mess

910
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:50,037
car is go go time

911
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:53,203
maybe I don't care about my car couldn't have guests coming over

912
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,437
maybe the car is not important to the person

913
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:00,521
no mental energy for cleaning 

914
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:01,703
this is all good stuff

915
00:51:02,648 --> 00:51:05,170
we're this is the area where I'm a detective right

916
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,970
where I'm like what could be the explanation for this behavior 

917
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,373
I’m curious

918
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:16,570
one is elevated at the expense of the other

919
00:51:19,937 --> 00:51:20,970
one of my

920
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,303
the car is a more private versus

921
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,047
showing your home as to guests

922
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:34,737
a lot of times people will say well I don't live in my car right

923
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:36,803
there's all kinds of good reasons

924
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:39,037
and and none of these are wrong by the way

925
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,303
it could have been any of them right

926
00:51:42,337 --> 00:51:44,737
it could be just like a lack of energy or whatever

927
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:46,637
but very often people

928
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:49,770
would say well look I'm not trying to live in my car 

929
00:51:49,803 --> 00:51:52,120
it doesn't matter that it's not put together 

930
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,937
I might not have guests over or something 

931
00:51:56,337 --> 00:52:00,770
but all of those are basically ego defenses

932
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,537
because what we're saying to ourselves is look

933
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,237
we don't like when things don't agree

934
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,170
when two behaviors don't agree

935
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:13,237
so when things don't agree

936
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:20,403
we tend to force them to 

937
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:26,109
we will come up with a way 

938
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:30,037
to make these two incompatible behaviors agree 

939
00:52:30,037 --> 00:52:32,003
even though they don't right

940
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:34,803
and we will call that like a justification

941
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,137
right we will say to ourselves well

942
00:52:40,203 --> 00:52:41,603
I’m not living in my car

943
00:52:41,603 --> 00:52:44,237
it doesn't need to be clean I'm not showing it off to people

944
00:52:44,237 --> 00:52:47,137
it's not representative of my lifestyle as much

945
00:52:48,537 --> 00:52:51,851
these are just ways to make two incompatible behaviors 

946
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:54,170
that don't actually agree agree 

947
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:58,403
and I would rather come up with a way to make them agree

948
00:52:58,403 --> 00:52:59,918
and make this okay 

949
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:03,970
than do the digging for whatever is trying to come up to my conscious mind 

950
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,482
and that I'm sending back down by saying 

951
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:08,503
no there's like a rational reason for this 

952
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:12,737
it's because I don't sleep in my car right

953
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:17,237
here's another one that's that's very common as well 

954
00:53:18,437 --> 00:53:20,124
oh I went to the gym earlier today

955
00:53:20,124 --> 00:53:24,503
so today I’m gonna eat a bunch of sweets later I deserve it right

956
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,091
I’m gonna eat this cake 

957
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:29,603
because like I am gonna work out later right 

958
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:33,637
it does not make sense to go spend five hours at the gym 

959
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:39,037
and then blow it on eating sweets right after or later in the day right  

960
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:42,170
these are two behaviors that don't really agree

961
00:53:42,737 --> 00:53:45,637
and rather than sort out the disagreement

962
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:47,837
we just come up with ways to force them to

963
00:53:49,137 --> 00:53:52,437
and those are in defense of our ego right

964
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,537
that's that's an ego defense right there

965
00:53:57,637 --> 00:54:00,571
what I'm saying is there can be absolutely no reason for this behavior 

966
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,237
yeah  I mean I think that 

967
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:08,937
part of this is down to like these are simple examples right

968
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,586
where I'm talking about like  

969
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,248
the difference between cleaning an area of your life and not  

970
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:18,077
or just changing your impulse to eat something sweet or not 

971
00:54:19,037 --> 00:54:22,003
but think about this in a more complicated sense okay

972
00:54:22,003 --> 00:54:25,403
now that I've given you a simple example what is this right here

973
00:54:33,244 --> 00:54:35,570
what is a functional alcoholic

974
00:54:36,137 --> 00:54:38,370
if not exactly this right

975
00:54:39,603 --> 00:54:42,437
oh well I am able to go to work or go to school 

976
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:43,703
and I get my stuff done

977
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:46,592
and I'm not destroying my life in this area

978
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:49,570
and so like you know I'm functioning 

979
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,837
even though I'm drinking all the time at home

980
00:54:51,837 --> 00:54:57,037
and I'm not putting a lot of you know effort into stopping that

981
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,237
this is the same thing right here okay

982
00:55:01,237 --> 00:55:05,237
except it's on a more complicated subject

983
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:09,254
these two behaviors do not agree with one another  

984
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:12,994
to be diligent and measured 

985
00:55:12,994 --> 00:55:18,934
and taking lots of care to keep your life structured in only one area 

986
00:55:18,934 --> 00:55:22,822
and then not putting any of that structure in your health

987
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:24,991
or your finances

988
00:55:25,134 --> 00:55:27,701
or whatever you have to do to keep the lifestyle of addiction up

989
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:30,801
and so yeah two things don't agree here

990
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:34,367
but we force them to we come up with a way to

991
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:40,134
not integrate whatever is trying to come up to the surface here

992
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:42,801
which is that like wow I have a problem 

993
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:46,401
like imagine someone discovering that idea that 

994
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:51,467
oh actually being an alcoholic is making parts of my life unmanageable  

995
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:54,601
or is ruining relationships right

996
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:56,201
and to become aware of that

997
00:55:56,201 --> 00:55:59,401
would start to change the make up of your self-esteem

998
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:01,967
it would start asking you to change behaviors

999
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:04,369
you have to you know 

1000
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:07,334
suddenly give up this thing that you've become dependent on 

1001
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,501
it's a lot of work and a lot of effort 

1002
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:12,467
and so what we do is our eco defense gets involved 

1003
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:17,934
and keeps this from coming to the surface and it will stay down here 

1004
00:56:20,301 --> 00:56:22,997
because we've come up with a way to make a degree

1005
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:27,214
so this is a force that opposes 

1006
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:31,468
your behavioral changes and your cognitive changes 

1007
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:36,712
and I see a lot of that in what is going on with 

1008
00:56:36,712 --> 00:56:38,667
our own rigorous self critique here 

1009
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,534
every time we learn something new

1010
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:47,200
there is a chance for us to suppress it 

1011
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:52,883
and Volition and Inland Empire they have in some ways been ego defenses 

1012
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:56,734
to be no you don't have to integrate these things

1013
00:56:59,134 --> 00:57:02,767
it's okay for these not to agree who you were and who you are

1014
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:03,967
you can just be a new person

1015
00:57:05,498 --> 00:57:10,967
but I think that this is unhelpful for Harry's healing right

1016
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:13,734
I genuinely think that it's much healthier

1017
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:17,134
for all of this stuff to come up here

1018
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:20,239
and even if it is psychologically damaging in the moment  

1019
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:22,934
to have the kinds of protective factors

1020
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:24,713
to integrate it in a healthy way right

1021
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:27,867
and we'll talk about protective factors in a moment

1022
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:30,201
like we don't just want to suddenly

1023
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:32,401
make everything bad about our life conscious

1024
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:33,734
because it would break us down

1025
00:57:33,734 --> 00:57:35,534
that's what Volition is worried about

1026
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,418
but we can't just go through our life 

1027
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:41,767
with our house clean and our car dirty 

1028
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:44,295
I mean we can but bigger picture  

1029
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:46,752
we cannot go through Harry's life with 

1030
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:49,034
I used to be a shit cop and a shit person 

1031
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:51,401
and now I'm trying to be a good cop and a good person

1032
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,567
and does totally separate them

1033
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:56,467
if we want to actually heal from this

1034
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:58,801
we're going to need to make a lot of that stuff conscious

1035
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:02,667
and not try to defend ourselves from the lack of agreement

1036
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:06,847
we're going to have to find ways to face the idea that  

1037
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:09,501
we are a walking contradiction

1038
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:13,734
but there are things we can address to make them more consistent 

1039
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:15,301
and it's this stuff right here

1040
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:19,801
so this applies to harry's life

1041
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:22,725
and applies to the lives of a lot of people who I work with  

1042
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:26,701
who again you know is is a lot of people in addiction 

1043
00:58:26,867 --> 00:58:30,701
who may not even remember everything that they've done

1044
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:33,201
may have very similar experiences to Harry

1045
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:37,201
where they have stolen from family members to support their addiction 

1046
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:40,967
they've committed crimes to support their addiction

1047
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:42,747
they've done all kinds of stuff that 

1048
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:45,367
as a sober person today they are not happy with 

1049
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:47,801
and I am not working with them on

1050
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:51,201
how to somehow make those two lives compatible

1051
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,501
by saying like well it was your addiction its its

1052
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,534
it's not who you were it's like well

1053
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:02,467
let's embrace the fact that we're not happy about those things 

1054
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:04,566
and find a healthy way to integrate them 

1055
00:59:04,566 --> 00:59:06,734
by working on what they represent to you 

1056
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:09,956
if we need to work on selfishness let's do it right 

1057
00:59:10,616 --> 00:59:12,934
if we need to work on our regrets 

1058
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:15,267
then we need to learn how to make amends to people

1059
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:19,467
rather than just try to move on from it

1060
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:26,501
that's my viewpoint on why we have been going about

1061
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:31,078
approaching Harry's past and his present

1062
00:59:33,635 --> 00:59:35,919
you know I think that like not looking in the mirror  

1063
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,801
in some ways is like one of these

1064
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:42,262
like here's two things that don't agree

1065
00:59:43,901 --> 00:59:46,669
I don't know a lot about who I am 

1066
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:48,601
so I'm gonna

1067
00:59:50,701 --> 00:59:54,067
deny myself looking in the mirror right

1068
00:59:56,167 --> 01:00:00,867
to actually like face that side of ourselves would mean 

1069
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:05,841
embracing some of these uncomfortable unconscious things

1070
01:00:06,901 --> 01:00:09,934
I just think don't think that we were ready yet until recently

1071
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:12,967
until we have started to actually do some good deeds right

1072
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:14,901
because what we did recently was

1073
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:21,267
we gained some self-respect in our interactions with Annette

1074
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:25,734
we have changed some of our impulse control by not

1075
01:00:27,301 --> 01:00:31,144
chasing around every bit of alcohol and cigarette 

1076
01:00:31,144 --> 01:00:33,667
we struggled at first but we're doing it now 

1077
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:38,401
we don't have to be as shameful about who we used to be

1078
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,867
because we are apologizing for a lot of it right

1079
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:46,501
this is stuff that we are still struggling with

1080
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:48,801
is like how not to be authoritative

1081
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:53,701
my read on Harry is that like when he gets in a bind

1082
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:58,301
he's still struggling not to like do the kinds of things he used to do 

1083
01:00:58,301 --> 01:01:03,193
which was holding someone in a in a room 

1084
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,953
which we just learned that he did 

1085
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:08,768
like it's very in line with me trying to just arrest everybody

1086
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,167
so this is still an area of work

1087
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:15,244
but we are changing our selfishness we're changing our composure

1088
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:18,267
our accuracy is definitely much better

1089
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:19,567
after shooting the guy down

1090
01:01:19,734 --> 01:01:22,067
and we're trying to be accountable by apologizing

1091
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:23,334
by a lot of things right

1092
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:27,567
and in addressing who we look like

1093
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:29,667
is sort of addressing the shame around that

1094
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:33,886
our Harry is going through a journey of 

1095
01:01:33,886 --> 01:01:39,680
change and acceptance and development   

1096
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,301
and it's messy and it's not it's not holistic either 

1097
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:46,581
not all of these things are going to come together all at once

1098
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:52,767
for example this one is still very much in work in progress 

1099
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:55,705
but I fucking love this 

1100
01:01:55,705 --> 01:01:59,372
I love this rigorous self critique thing this game mechanic  

1101
01:01:59,372 --> 01:02:03,992
because it's so representative of this issue 

1102
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:09,201
that is like very common in psychological work right

1103
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:17,304
this journey doesn't sound very disco  I mean it's a  

1104
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:19,027
it's the journey that we're on 

1105
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:33,438
are ego defenses ever valid in their reasoning 

1106
01:02:33,438 --> 01:02:37,401
yes so I'll tell you about some more ego defenses 

1107
01:02:38,267 --> 01:02:40,267
which are not the worst thing ever right like

1108
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:43,576
displacement is one of them

1109
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:49,667
we talked about displacement

1110
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,534
which is like the

1111
01:02:56,334 --> 01:02:58,567
when we're dealing with something

1112
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:02,367
where we don't have the right target for an emotion

1113
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:04,021
so we displace it to someone else 

1114
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:06,334
right again to become aware of that 

1115
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:08,901
to make an unconscious feeling conscious

1116
01:03:09,701 --> 01:03:11,722
could be damaging to ourselves which is that  

1117
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:15,939
look I'm struggling with anger at myself over who I used to be

1118
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:18,367
so I lash out at everyone around me

1119
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:19,767
like that would be really insightful

1120
01:03:19,767 --> 01:03:21,601
but it would also bring up a lot of shame

1121
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:24,446
and so displace it would mean like 

1122
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,573
we just attribute it to someone else 

1123
01:03:26,573 --> 01:03:28,701
and say yeah no I’m pissed off because 

1124
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:32,301
you know I can't find my badge

1125
01:03:32,301 --> 01:03:34,267
and that's not my fault it's someone else's fault

1126
01:03:34,267 --> 01:03:35,934
like it's an ego defense right

1127
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:44,798
the two other common ones are what I might call 

1128
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:47,101
sour grapes and 

1129
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:49,909
sweet lemon

1130
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:55,742
so a sour grape right

1131
01:03:56,067 --> 01:04:00,401
this comes from an Aesop's Fable where there's a fox whose

1132
01:04:02,734 --> 01:04:05,067
going through the forest and he finds some grapes

1133
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:10,534
some delicious sustenance in the jungle or whatever forest 

1134
01:04:10,534 --> 01:04:11,901
and he wants them

1135
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:14,801
but there's like a thorn bush between him and the grapes

1136
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:16,701
and so what he tells himself right 

1137
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:21,378
because he can't get them is that they must be sour 

1138
01:04:21,578 --> 01:04:23,118
like I didn't want those grapes anyways 

1139
01:04:23,118 --> 01:04:25,575
they're probably sour I probably wouldn't want them 

1140
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,101
like this is an ego defense right 

1141
01:04:29,442 --> 01:04:34,119
this is what happens when someone gets rejected

1142
01:04:34,934 --> 01:04:37,346
and then they're like yeah well whatever you're ugly anyways

1143
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:40,793
you've just made this into a sour grape like  

1144
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:46,534
you wanted something and instead of embracing the idea that 

1145
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,181
you can't have something that you want all the time

1146
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:53,884
and that that's like you would embrace the idea that 

1147
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:56,401
you know maybe I'm not attractive to this person 

1148
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,801
our ego defense gets in the way

1149
01:04:58,801 --> 01:05:01,365
and it keeps it at an unconscious level 

1150
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:03,932
to say that yeah well you didn't even really want that thing 

1151
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:09,213
so that's a sour grape and the opposite of that is a sweet lemon

1152
01:05:09,567 --> 01:05:14,940
which is this is making this is 

1153
01:05:16,017 --> 01:05:18,651
forcing a good situation to be bad

1154
01:05:19,101 --> 01:05:23,001
this is forcing a bad situation to be good right

1155
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:25,734
it's like biting into a lemon

1156
01:05:25,734 --> 01:05:27,914
and telling yourself that it's actually quite sweet

1157
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:30,467
and that it's not sour at all right 

1158
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:34,901
a good example of this would be like

1159
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:39,534
let's say I'm you know in a fucking office all day

1160
01:05:39,534 --> 01:05:41,267
and it's super hot and I'm sweating

1161
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:43,001
and it's like making me dehydrated

1162
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:47,134
and so I tell myself  you know this is really uncomfortable right now  

1163
01:05:47,134 --> 01:05:48,901
but at least it's getting me to drink more water

1164
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:50,567
I have been trying to drink more

1165
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,583
right like what you have done is

1166
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:57,640
you have forced two things that don't really agree

1167
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,344
to somehow have a better outcome.

1168
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,104
sweating is actually good for me because it's making me hydrate more 

1169
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,430
It comes through when people are like well

1170
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,386
you know this job doesn't pay me enough

1171
01:06:22,386 --> 01:06:24,203
but that's actually good for me 

1172
01:06:24,203 --> 01:06:27,600
because I'll have less money which will teach me to budget better 

1173
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,980
right that's not like

1174
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,170
someone asked if the ego defenses are always negative

1175
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,314
and this is what I'd say no it's not that negative

1176
01:06:35,314 --> 01:06:37,314
like look if that's your reality

1177
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,981
if you're Frittte girl

1178
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:41,530
 and stop me from talking about her

1179
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,700
if I if I'm going back down that direction

1180
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,251
but imagine you're Frittte girl okay

1181
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,410
her whole fucking life has to be a sweet lemon just to survive all right 

1182
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:55,954
she has to go into her fucking claustrophobic little booth 

1183
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,956
and tell herself that like

1184
01:06:58,956 --> 01:07:04,140
 oh this bad situation this fucking lemon of a life 

1185
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,020
is actually quite sweet to me right 

1186
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:12,240
because not getting paid teaches me to budget better 

1187
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:17,320
having to spend all day here keeps me from spending time at home

1188
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,100
where I don't feel like anyone listens to me

1189
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,210
every time I go to work I'm reminded of how bad my life is

1190
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:29,300
and it makes me work harder to get out of this

1191
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,770
have you ever felt like that

1192
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:35,600
that the job you have and everything around it

1193
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,140
and the people that you have to work with that you may not like

1194
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,210
and you look at them and you're like I'm glad I'm facing this

1195
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:45,440
because it is reminding me of what's important to me

1196
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,400
and that I need to get out of this right

1197
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,530
then that's what you're doing right here

1198
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,960
and this one's not so bad right

1199
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,470
I think that this is these are not all equal

1200
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:59,600
that's not forcing something to be unconscious in like a suppressive way

1201
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,520
what it's doing is protecting ourselves from the ego

1202
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,120
which which would chime in to say

1203
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,770
your life sucks and they're getting nothing out of this

1204
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,060
like I think we just have to believe that

1205
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,290
even the bad things we're going through are worth something

1206
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,373
and in that sense this is not a problem right

1207
01:08:17,373 --> 01:08:20,240
that's a coping skill in some ways

1208
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,970
as long as it's not leading to like deep denial right

1209
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,530
so it's a thin line between helpful positivity and sweet lemons

1210
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:34,270
or is sweet lemon toxic positivity

1211
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,660
no I think yeah

1212
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,770
toxic positivity would be like

1213
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,779
always saying well look at the bright side right

1214
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,000
I think that sweet lemon is not as bad

1215
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,130
because there's still an acknowledgement that the situation sucks

1216
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,850
you're not trying to like twist reality

1217
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,980
because like toxic positivity to me would be like

1218
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,941
going into Frittte girls job and being like no I actually do like this

1219
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:04,252
you know it's actually interesting to see the people and  

1220
01:09:04,252 --> 01:09:09,560
like no then you're trying to make something positive when it's not 

1221
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,080
at least here you're telling yourself yeah this does suck

1222
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,562
it like it really is shit but 

1223
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:18,600
I got to get something out of this 

1224
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,010
even if it's just motivation to change it

1225
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,690
right

1226
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,120
so that's one of the the ego defenses that's like not super bad for you

1227
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,650
but yeah a couple of other ones are like projection right

1228
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:40,920
projections when we hear a lot of the idea is that you are 

1229
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:46,100
you think you're looking at a window but you're actually looking at a mirror

1230
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:49,335
you're looking at someone else and saying

1231
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:52,490
yeah this guy's a pain in the ass he thinks he's so smart

1232
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:58,080
what's his deal what a jerk right 

1233
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,600
and I think I'm like looking at someone through a window like I'm not

1234
01:10:03,085 --> 01:10:04,570
like I'm not seeing that that's actually me

1235
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,770
and I'm actually looking at a mirror and I'm like

1236
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:12,430
wow I hate the idea that you know this person 

1237
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:16,830
intellectualizes things to hide from their insecurities or whatever

1238
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,210
again it's keeping something from surfacing here

1239
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,150
right

1240
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,620
it's a defense against the ego

1241
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:30,140
and the ego just meaning the thing that dictates what reality is to you right

1242
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:36,400
another common one is called reaction formation

1243
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:42,560
reaction formation is when you express the opposite of what you feel

1244
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,080
so kids experience this a lot when they are

1245
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,418
picking on the girl who sits next to them but they actually like them

1246
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,820
right when you're mean to someone that you actually like

1247
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,730
that's reaction formation

1248
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:01,450
and we have probably seen a lot of this in Kim's behavior

1249
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,150
where he says things like I'm not interested in this

1250
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,810
but he actually kind of is

1251
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:09,742
why might he be doing that

1252
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,160
unconsciously

1253
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:18,900
there is a desire to be a little more free and loose and whatever else 

1254
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:26,548
but part of his like whole thing is staying composed and professional 

1255
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:33,210
and so he doesn't always allow this like childlike spirit to come out 

1256
01:11:33,798 --> 01:11:37,040
 and so he keeps it here by using this

1257
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:43,160
I'm not interested in this he said interested yeah

1258
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,136
he's separating work and personal stuff

1259
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,910
yeah I mean like again these are not all bad

1260
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,170
do not get that idea ego defenses are not bad

1261
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:58,490
they are just worthy of being investigated 

1262
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:59,950
that like

1263
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:03,970
look if you're struggling to face the thing in reality

1264
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,040
there might be a reason for that right

1265
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,010
and if we find that it's not worth bringing into reality that's fine

1266
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:11,514
but we do have to notice that

1267
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,300
we do force things to agree when they don't

1268
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,910
that's what this is about

1269
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,880
yeah a tsundere is a little bit like that right

1270
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,530
pretending not to like someone

1271
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:28,670
when you actually do

1272
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,700
a cigarette a day

1273
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,410
exactly this is kind of an ego defense as well

1274
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,840
it's a kind of a justification right

1275
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,390
it doesn't really agree with like

1276
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,520
it not being a full habit

1277
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:56,830
but still doing it like it's a habit just not at that intensity or something like that

1278
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,330
can you explain the core difference

1279
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:05,120
between intellectualization and rationalization

1280
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:09,591
I would say intellectualization is like

1281
01:13:09,591 --> 01:13:13,130
talking about an emotional subject in an abstract way

1282
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,820
giving a history of an emotion rather than

1283
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,220
expressing it

1284
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:29,331
where where I'm like yeah

1285
01:13:29,331 --> 01:13:32,480
I got in an argument with my friend yesterday and he made me so mad

1286
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:36,270
like I'm just giving you a history

1287
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:39,720
I'm like reading the Wikipedia version of what happened

1288
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,690
that would be kind of like intellectualizing

1289
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:44,200
which again is not bad

1290
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,520
it's just that's not our objective

1291
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,620
if our objective is to be emotionally insightful

1292
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,990
then we want to avoid that

1293
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,810
and rationalization

1294
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:00,460
it's kind of similar to this

1295
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:05,230
it's coming up with a logical reason to do something like

1296
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:09,333
well I don't live in my car so there's no reason for me to clean it 

1297
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,553
yeah anyways I bring all this up  

1298
01:14:12,553 --> 01:14:16,684
because I think it's very relevant to what we just learned about

1299
01:14:16,684 --> 01:14:19,630
the ideas of rigorous self-critique right

1300
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,490
which this is not just self-critique

1301
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:27,720
it's rigorous it's painful it's it's challenging 

1302
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,190
it's challenging to this right here the ego

1303
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:36,290
which is defining our our understanding of reality 

1304
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:40,480
it's trying to integrate ideas of morality and ideas of

1305
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:46,280
like the primordial voice right

1306
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,800
so yeah pretty interesting

1307
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,227
that we just learned more like an hour ago

1308
01:14:56,227 --> 01:14:56,730
 yeah I know

1309
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,210
I know I know

1310
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,860
okay let's

1311
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,250
let's return to what we were doing
