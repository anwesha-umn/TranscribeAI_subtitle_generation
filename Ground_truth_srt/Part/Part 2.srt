1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:01,066
okay

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,233
hello 

3
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:06,166
and welcome back to our playthrough of disco elysium

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,466
we just finished kind of like the first little chunk of the game 

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
kind of starting our character

6
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,653
and yeah just figuring out who he is 

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,608
in this wild disgusting world 

8
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:26,790
and how wild and disgusting are we going to be to 

9
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:28,933
kind of meet the world where it's at

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,237
so I've sort of decided that the character profile 

11
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,351
we're going with is like 

12
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:39,266
ex or failed therapist turned dirty cop 

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,000
kind of the idea like

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,733
I tried to be a therapist

15
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:47,660
but I found it was too easy to manipulate people 

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,500
or the more I learned about people 

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,366
the more I could not help the urge to exploit that stuff

18
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,787
so I became a cop instead 

19
00:00:56,107 --> 00:01:01,467
where I can hide behind a moral or duty justification 

20
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:04,563
for getting information from people

21
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:05,997
and I can sort of code that as 

22
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,797
this is a good thing for me and them 

23
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:11,097
I'm actually protecting them by figuring out their dark secrets 

24
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:12,763
so that's kind of where we're at

25
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,400
let's continue

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,623
keep working on this crime here 

27
00:01:24,697 --> 00:01:26,966
literally just came back at the perfect time hell yeah

28
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:28,733
let's fucking go

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,696
okay let's check out the crime scene a little bit more here 

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,233
get some cash lying around 

31
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,733
never gonna let that go to waste 

32
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,533
some more magnesium

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,900
I'm thinking we're gonna need to stock up on magnesium

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,866
this winch mechanism has been oxidating for some years

35
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,600
the kids ladder is climbable

36
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,133
okay not too much interesting going on around here 

37
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,566
let's check out the body

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,133
...with bulging white eyes 

39
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,266
the face around them does not look human 

40
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,933
it's swollen and ready to burst 

41
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,875
his lips are fish like 

42
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,933
and his tongue like a bull gag in his mouth 

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,366
pretty gruesome

44
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,500
you seem to be holding your breath

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,666
a cargo belt twists his neck at an unnatural angle 

46
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,866
the body below appears stiff 

47
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,166
it's letting out an ungodly rot 

48
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:42,333
the smell seeps in even through your clenched nostrils

49
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,900
legendary let go of your nose without throwing up

50
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,133
that 17 percent

51
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,111
has not steered me wrong yet

52
00:02:57,316 --> 00:03:00,866
oh it looks like my camera is frozen okay

53
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,275
so all of this has just been cut out of the recording

54
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:09,425
but my other camera is having some issues 

55
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,492
so I've gone back to the old camera 

56
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,366
 it is what it is 

57
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:17,766
if there's a noticeable drop an image quality that's why

58
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,100
let's continue

59
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,466
I'm gonna go for the

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,766
I'm gonna go for the low percentage roll

61
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,700
I've gotten pretty lucky with it so far 

62
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,556
and see what happens 

63
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,500
as you breathe in the odour comes over you

64
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,266
it's a spell of the mind telling you to run 

65
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,000
and your stomach to wring itself empty 

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,300
with your hands at your sides and your eyes squinting you stand in it 

67
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:52,500
my dude is

68
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
is the luckiest motherfucker

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,000
I swear turn off the cheats there are no cheats I swear

70
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,800
you guys saw me boot this up

71
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:12,066
as you breathe in the odour comes in over you 

72
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,236
it's a spell of the mind telling you to run 

73
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:19,000
all I really achieved was that I didn't throw up

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,033
it's highly skilled individual 

75
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,400
let's get closer since we can withstand it 

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,466
the man before you is naked

77
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,900
but for a pair of underpants and enameled boots

78
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,666
his skin is greenish 

79
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,666
marbled with decaying veins and blotched by lividity 

80
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,633
a fading web of tattoos covers his chest and shoulders 

81
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,600
the cargo belt used to fasten him to the branch above 

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,333
appears industrial in strength

83
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,450
I'm sitting in front of my window which has these blinds 

84
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,966
and I keep them closed but

85
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,966
the cats like to hit them and so I get sun in my eyes

86
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,333
all right

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,100
let's get a look at that belt

88
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,333
the hangman's knot is pulled tight 

89
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,946
by the weight of the corpse below 

90
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:25,700
yellow hard edged polyester cuts into his neck 

91
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,133
above a sliding buckle ties the belt to the branch

92
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,400
oh my there's something on the belt 

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,300
a familiar word that speaks to the thirst within you

94
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:49,133
yeah no black Marvel what you're gonna see is exactly that 

95
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,733
like that's the kind of luck I tend to have 

96
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,633
where the really like easy shit 

97
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,966
all the stuff I spec my builds out for 

98
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,000
I fail every time

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,325
VERMILLON

100
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:05,900
in yellow letters along the length of the twisting cargo belt 

101
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,966
only a deep longing for Vermillion golden spirits 

102
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:14,385
lets you decipher the fading logo of the local brewery

103
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,104
I knew it it's the fucking bartender 

104
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,933
no you should not get a drink 

105
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:24,933
you should perform an initial inspection of the victim's corpse 

106
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,400
we are on the rope part

107
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:33,466
industrial strength the kind used for tying cargo to lorries

108
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,300
hey pockeysucker thanks

109
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,533
so much for the sub my friend 

110
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,933
for five months appreciate you always 

111
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,200
good to see you around

112
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,200
enjoy that （？） emote

113
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,966
like in a circus

114
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,542
when the circus leaves town 

115
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:50,100
and they tie a black spotted giraffe to the wall of a carry-pen

116
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:54,900
let's go with that

117
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,150
no more like in harbor like the one just east of here

118
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,050
I get to sense they used whatever was on hand 

119
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,133
without paying much attention to not incriminating themselves

120
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm losing Kim's respects by every time I open my mouth

121
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,766
that doesn't necessarily mean that dock workers did it though

122
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:31,541
my brain's ability to connect cosmic coincidences 

123
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,845
that's like the inland empire one 

124
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,933
is starting to steer me wrong a little bit

125
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,300
yeah sensitive archetype

126
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,466
the brief suggested as much 

127
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,900
politically motivated by the ongoing strike 

128
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:54,733
did you not get a briefing 

129
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:56,957
of course I got a briefing Kim

130
00:07:56,957 --> 00:08:00,400
 I just probably didn't read it or forgot that I read it 

131
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:04,175
my past has got undergone total annihilation nothing remains 

132
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,214
my mother the love of my life certainly not a briefing

133
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,266
（选项：没有 他们可能忘记告诉我了）
let's blame it on someone else

134
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:13,266
then you should ask me the first moment we get

135
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,066
why not blame the dock workers

136
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,700
I guess that's a fair argument

137
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,966
you should ask me the first moment I get okay

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,131
（选项：他们是怎么把他弄上去的？）
a noose is one of those things that's easier to use one way around  

139
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,500
a noose is one of those things that's easier to use one way around  

140
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,700
I think they lassoed the branch 

141
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,133
then pulled on the belt buckle closes

142
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,733
it's what I would do seems easier than climbing out there

143
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,233
it's not merely polyester it's steel reinforced 

144
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,533
see these lines this is where the wires run 

145
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:50,400
I see rabbets for more than 20 strands

146
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:57,933
this makes getting him down much more problematic than I had assumed 

147
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:03,900
kim's worldly experience is really affording him some insight here 

148
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,600
we've got to catch up to him 

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
do you think it's because he's sober

150
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,333
the cadaver hangs from a cargo belt 

151
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,966
limbs limp and torso covered in tattoos

152
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,900
hmm let's go look at those tattoos

153
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,146
an intricate web of blue line stretches across the torso

154
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,356
 from the right shoulder to the solar plexus 

155
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:30,456
each time they intersect a small white star is formed in their crossing

156
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,833
 hundreds of fading asterisks riddle his skin 

157
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,500
the concentration is highest around his heart

158
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,933
his corpse is marked by stars

159
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,975
what will mine be marked by 

160
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,500
alcohol and heartbreak

161
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,066
your fist clenches suddenly

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,900
it'll be riddled with disco hell yeah

163
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,266
decay is creeping on the tattoo 

164
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:02,025
already most of the canvas that's holding it has darkened

165
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:07,150
now it disintegrates slowly letting out a stink

166
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:10,033
is this a map of the night sky 

167
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:13,700
national pattern a microelectronic system

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,766
probably a national pattern this looks like a

169
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,566
a crime to demonstrate something 

170
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,633
of no nation that I know of 

171
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:29,433
if anything it reminds me of religious illumination 

172
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,233
last or penultimate century 

173
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:35,866
men who live harsh lives often turn to innocentic worship

174
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,566
but which one I see no trace of a humanoid figure

175
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:41,833
Kim is on to it 

176
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:46,400
the pattern does not stir patriotic or religious sentiment in you

177
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:52,100
what it does is speak to the wounded limping animal the male in particular  

178
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,666
unable to communicate in anything more than grunts 

179
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:00,400
it's impossible to tell if its advice is right or wrong

180
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:02,540
so am I

181
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,600
why did you do that 

182
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,165
he takes a thin piece of milld aluminium from his coat pocket and pulls it open 

183
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:15,700
sounds like a sword being unsheathed

184
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:19,275
a small lens appears some sort of camera

185
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,966
let the lieutenant work we trust we trust him

186
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,866
shit Cuno what the fuck is that 

187
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:26,900
an instant color camera

188
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,409
he produces two metal-capped ampoules 

189
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,574
and clicks them into place on the side of the apparatus

190
00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:33,933
a thin slot shines

191
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:37,841
this is the first time he openly acknowledges the kid's existence

192
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:39,207
I have only two ampoules

193
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,807
so nobody move I don't want to waste one

194
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:46,355
...points the camera at the corpse peering into it the lens needs adjusting then  

195
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,378
a sound a shrill flash 

196
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:51,813
followed by the breaking of a small ampoule of glass 

197
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,366
you see streams of colour pour 

198
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:58,227
onto the thick glossy piece of paper rolling out 

199
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,547
in case we need it

200
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,900
the style of this game is so 

201
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,720
confident and unique

202
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,445
to me when I think about playing games and especially narrative games

203
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,700
the word that comes to mind is friction like

204
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,315
how much friction is between me and the narrative

205
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:18,900
for example when you're playing like

206
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,666
I don't know an open world game like 

207
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:23,566
the narrative is often telling me 

208
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,666
you need to go to this specific place

209
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,266
but the game is telling me like no go wherever you want

210
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:33,050
and so there's friction just meaning in the sense 

211
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,553
that like the more that's applied 

212
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,920
the more I feel like I want to slow down

213
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,933
whereas like when there's no friction 

214
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,333
it feels like what i'm doing in the game 

215
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,566
and what the narrative is asking of me are just like 

216
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,633
they're the same thread that's being pulled on 

217
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,966
here this is great

218
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:54,600
it's ugly but in an artistic way

219
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,600
ludo narrative dissonance yeah

220
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,466
译注："ludonarrative    dissonance" 是游戏设计 领域的术语，用以描述玩法 ludology和叙事narrative 之间的矛盾。相应的设计挑 战为，如何在游戏的玩法和 叙事之间保持一致性，以提 供更加深入的游戏体验。

this is a bigger brain way to say it 

222
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,366
I just like the word for friction

223
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:09,900
which I also use in psychology sometimes 

224
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,578
so friction is actually a psychological term in that sense 

225
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:13,033
译注：心理摩擦力-friction 可类比物理概念来理解，即 让一个行为不能顺畅发生的 因素叫作摩擦力。该概念常 用于行为塑造、习惯培养。 （如，将爆米花放到房间远 处可显著减少摄入量）

how much friction is introduced

229
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:20,733
how much friction is introduced

230
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,133
how much friction do you introduce to your own behavior

231
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:27,366
for example if I'm trying to quit smoking 

232
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,725
or in the context of this game start 

233
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:34,000
right now there's a lot of friction between me and starting that behavior 

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,812
number one I can't find any cigarettes

235
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,881
 number two I don't think anyone would give me one

236
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:41,980
 and so I'm supposed to rely on my critical faculties 

237
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,343
to find a unattended cigarette

238
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:50,066
to scour pennies

239
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,663
so that I can afford my own cigarettes

240
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:56,363
or to beat someone up and take their cigarettes 

241
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,900
it's getting my decision making gets impaired

242
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,466
because there's too much friction between me and what I want 

243
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:09,100
and so I start looking for shortcuts

244
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,966
that's genuinely where you make a lot of bad decisions

245
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:18,866
cool machine

246
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:21,500
yes it is pretty cool isn't it

247
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,200
oh Kim actually does have a personality 

248
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,800
it contains inside to the victim 

249
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,166
I'm sorry that was mean I didn't mean that Kim

250
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:31,300
I'd say this was a man of physical violence 

251
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,456
the story he wanted his body to tell was important to him 

252
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,900
it is his letter to us someone should decipher it 

253
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,766
we need to show it around 

254
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,366
your personality is honesty and earnestness 

255
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,866
and that's enough for me 

256
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:46,376
can I have it 

257
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:48,965
I should look at it later without the corpse smell

258
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,337
I think Kim should hang on to it 

259
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:54,770
he's a little more responsible

260
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,525
here a souvenir don't lose it

261
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,300
it's no longer than a pack of cigarettes okay

262
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,333
kiddie

263
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,933
this is the time of day it's the hardest to stream at 

264
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,900
because the sun is right outside my window 

265
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,400
and if these blinds move at all I can't see shit

266
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,100
the glassy-eyed corpse looks by 

267
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,631
his mouth mute

268
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:30,150
 and his skin as colorful as the chemical rainbow on the photo paper 

269
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,800
teeming with opportunistic organisms

270
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,333
you've acquired an interactable item 

271
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:41,466
investigate this item further by going to the interact tab in your inventory

272
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:46,650
（选项：调查靴子）

273
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,824
（选项：调查靴子）
the material appears to be ceramic

274
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:48,975
the material appears to be ceramic

275
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:51,133
 its clean white stands in stark

276
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,700
contrast to the decaying flesh above the knee 

277
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,866
the man wore thick polymer socks probably for padding 

278
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:02,700
a fine array of interlocking plates covers them 

279
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,366
delicate and fragile 

280
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:09,125
they feel alien to the world around you out of place somehow

281
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:10,686
（选项：这是什么样的靴子？）

282
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:11,817
（选项：这是什么样的靴子？）
they're armour not boots

283
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:12,436
they're armour not boots

284
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:15,603
technically speaking these are sabatons

285
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:16,938
sabatons

286
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:18,136
（选项：什么样的盔甲？）

287
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:19,061
（选项：什么样的盔甲？）
pceramic plate zirconium dioxide most likely 

288
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,733
pceramic plate zirconium dioxide most likely 

289
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,757
this is where the make would be under the heel

290
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,564
Fairweather Fairweather model T-500/VE

291
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm guessing that's vitrius enamel 

292
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:34,028
this is advanced stuff

293
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:38,066
yeah where the fuck did these things come from

294
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:40,733
（选项：其余部分哪去了？）

295
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,875
（选项：其余部分哪去了？）
the locals probably scavenged it

296
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,866
the locals probably scavenged it

297
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:46,166
it would be odd if he had more on after seven days

298
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,596
we should keep a look up for these pieces 

299
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,668
the armor could yield information 

300
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,333
maybe he'll know something 

301
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,066
if you wear those pieces

302
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,866
it will help me protect your mortal coil

303
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,566
maybe he was just wearing those boots and 

304
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,866
there is no rest of the armor no probably not

305
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:10,462
the sabatons dangle off the man's decaying form

306
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,392
ageless and synthetic

307
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
let's take him off

308
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,700
this feels dangerous

309
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,141
are you sure

310
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:24,200
okay even my fucking reptilian brain is telling me not to 

311
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,379
so I'm not gonna try

312
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,766
the sabatons dangle off the man's decaying form

313
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:34,740
I love how it gave me a second chance at making not a shit decision 

314
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,019
how about I don't touch it 

315
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,601
（选项：这种材质看上去有些突兀）
maybe I don't touch the crime scene let's make an observation instead

316
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:40,075
金：确实 它很贵
maybe I don't touch the crime scene let's make an observation instead

317
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:46,266
we've requested similar material for our tactical units for years now

318
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,133
the constabulary's deemed it too costly 

319
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,333
in that time we've lost six men to semi-automatics 

320
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,502
how much we talking here

321
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:57,092
for a full set about four years of wages

322
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:05,800
okay my instinct is telling me to take the sabatons to get the money

323
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:13,700
but my relationship with Kim is evolving and very important to me right now 

324
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,466
all right and the inland empires were my imagination than reptilian brain well

325
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,900
it's steering me well so far 

326
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,410
（选项：我猜那是一大笔钱？）
as a wage it's regrettably small

327
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,100
as a wage it's regrettably small

328
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,533
but for a piece of hardware yes that's a lot

329
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,000
that's for us to find out 

330
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,700
my initial report on the area suggests 

331
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,695
he was a security guard for the harbor company 

332
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,695
but that just hearsay

333
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:38,548
（选项：这对安保人员来说有点过于先进了）

334
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:40,230
（选项：这对安保人员来说有点过于先进了）
I agree these equipment is way beyond what a guard can afford 

335
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,894
I agree these equipment is way beyond what a guard can afford 

336
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:46,825
cadaver slowly twists on the cargo belt 

337
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:52,125
his torso covered in tattoos and extremities blotched pink and blue

338
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,400
don't be afraid to be weird you know what cyber

339
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,133
your encouragement has me wanting to 

340
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,966
I at least want to knock on it 

341
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,566
a small bell like sound fills the air 

342
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:11,600
like tapping on the side of a porcelain cup 

343
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,133
the pry bar in your hand is itching for some action

344
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,000
what the fuck it knows i have the pry bar in my hand

345
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,666
I mean that's fate right i have to smack it

346
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,766
let's let's hit it 

347
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,600
the metal connects with the same ding 

348
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,466
the sound does not appear to get louder 

349
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,466
did you hear that a click

350
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,000
cybercat cyberspace cat

351
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,200
you're steering this investigation now

352
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
this is a kinetic redistributor 

353
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,100
it spreads the incoming energy horizontally from plate to plate 

354
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,633
when the plates connect there's a click 

355
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:50,946
that's the sound you heard 

356
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,333
see these lanes

357
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:56,574
the fuck did this guy go to school Kim where have you been all my life 

358
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,078
and can you explain things to me 

359
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:06,125
in that sort of like dull but intellectual voice all the time

360
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,266
you need to have the items equipped for the game to acknowledge them

361
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,333
 that's brilliant 

362
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,933
faint organic lines cover the plates where they separate into smaller ones

363
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,266
these plates then divide into smaller plates 

364
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:23,666
until there are hundreds of them altogether

365
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,800
I'm so glad I just was carrying this fucking thing around 

366
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,041
I don't know why I decided to do that 

367
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,465
I just thought it would be cool 

368
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:32,745
like the scales of some ancient white monster 

369
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,100
cracked and pearly

370
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,133
let's pull the boot off

371
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,941
this feels dangerous

372
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:39,733
do it

373
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,700
the stench fills your nostrils

374
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,400
as you push downward 

375
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,716
an ominous creaking sound comes from above 

376
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:47,266
stop

377
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,266
pig's gonna pull his head off

378
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:53,533
brutal

379
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,866
look Kim is telling me to stop

380
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm gonna stop

381
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,800
but I kind of want to push him a little bit

382
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:07,400
what's how is our trust going to evolve 

383
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,166
unless I know his limits okay

384
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,778
you're about to put his head off 

385
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:12,253
do it homo

386
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,666
well whoa this kid Cuno

387
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,166
I have to push back against that right

388
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,933
yes that's what I say 

389
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,866
you'll compromise the coroner's case if you do 

390
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,230
so please don't 

391
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,200
what are you trying to achieve anyway 

392
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,666
why are you hanging on to that boot

393
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:37,533
there may be clues in the boot

394
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,366
Kim there could be clues in there

395
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,430
maybe we should concentrate on what's outside the boot 

396
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,117
and leave what's inside to the boys at processing 

397
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:48,863
just these once besides

398
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:51,700
ah you're right you're right umcar

399
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,933
 I could impress Kim or the kids

400
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,533
you need to push your friendship a little bit 

401
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,366
okay how do I know where he stands

402
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,266
 is he gonna stand by me even when I make bad decisions 

403
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,566
because guess what buddy 

404
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:05,566
I'm gonna make a lot of those throughout this playthrough

405
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,066
Cuno s（cunoesse） oh there's two Cunos okay

406
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,833
there's no way you are getting them off 

407
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,600
all the organic matter in his body has been flowing down into the boots

408
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,466
 they are fused to his feet now 

409
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,743
why do you think the locals haven't scavenged them yet 

410
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,900
all right Kim don't

411
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,566
embarrass me like this in front of Cuno all right 

412
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,200
i appreciate like when you clarify things and 

413
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,400
when you give me essential information

414
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,200
but you you don't need to attack my character and

415
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,600
 like he already called me a homo right

416
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,933
which is not an insult by itself 

417
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:46,633
but the way he said it made me feel pretty upset 

418
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:52,334
so just don't don't contradict me in front of a crowd ever again 

419
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:53,501
how about that 

420
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:55,533
sure there's a way to peel them off

421
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:58,394
but first the body needs to be down 

422
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:03,375
and second it would probably be better if the lieutenant wasn't around

423
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,366
okay so maybe we gotta get rid of Kim

424
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:16,100
the anticipation makes you crack your fingers feels nice

425
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:18,666
nice and cracky

426
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,533
we'll just respectfully agree

427
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,583
processing will take care of them

428
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,072
 with the situation in the morgue

429
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:25,310
 it will yield nothing

430
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:27,114
but we must pick our fight 

431
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:28,566
should we continue

432
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,866
 the cadaver slowly twists on the cargo belt

433
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,900
his eyes are milky white and blind to the world 

434
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,233
protruding comically from their sockets 

435
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:43,366
there is no one home just sub-aquatic terrors there

436
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:47,266
sub aquatic terrors this is this a writing is so good

437
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:50,166
dark brown hair grows on his head 

438
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:55,433
his face is ready to explode from the organic processes inside 

439
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,233
the death's head grim has passed 

440
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:01,304
what remains is an unrecognisable mess 

441
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:04,484
underneath the curdled meat there is an expression

442
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:08,523
 not carried on his features but below inside 

443
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,855
an expression of pleasure 

444
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:15,556
this man was experiencing joy at the moment of his death

445
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,735
let's connect to him this is a pretty high chance

446
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:22,166
watch just watch okay I have not done any tomfoolery

447
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,100
with the chances of this game 

448
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,300
so far I've gotten extremely lucky

449
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:32,966
I'm gonna click on this and I guarantee it's gonna fail

450
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:34,925
（吊人：“我已经离开了”）

451
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:36,366
oh okay

452
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:38,466
I got lucky again

453
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,533
where have you gone

454
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,666
you stinking your boring

455
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,245
why are you feeling pleasure when you died

456
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:51,400
maybe I was getting my rocks off

457
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:57,066
eighty three percent is the exact opposite of seventeens good point

458
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:05,300
do I look like an erotic auto-asphyxiation type to you

459
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,466
um

460
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:09,333
maybe

461
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,966
yes

462
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:15,000
captain coppdromo 

463
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:21,001
I fear we are drifting away fixating on sexuality again 

464
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,300
let's go with a simpler question 

465
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,766
I'm a joke look at me

466
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:29,654
who were you alive

467
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,600
a killer a mother fucker and a killer 

468
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,326
takes one to no one

469
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:43,000
go ahead into the wild pale yonder

470
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:51,300
god that voice just makes my reptilian sprains like skin crawl 

471
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,708
in the past way out in the west

472
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,427
（选项：发生什么了）
what do you mean

473
00:25:58,427 --> 00:25:59,133
what do you mean

474
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,961
（选项：我在跟你说话）
it's the power of your

475
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,108
it's the power of your

476
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:04,893
black frothy liquid starts bubbling out of his lips

477
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:07,293
IMAGINATION

478
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:11,402
go ahead ask me more questions

479
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,470
you fucking love questions

480
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,100
yes I do

481
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,000
because you're a copparooni

482
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:24,133
look at all of them gone

483
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:27,600
do you want more questions

484
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:33,313
ah yeah give me a comical amount of questions

485
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:39,533
comin' right up coppprppni Roonie

486
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,300
this is getting up beat now

487
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,105
why do I feel like I forgotten something terrible

488
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,600
beacuse you have 

489
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,700
who killed you 

490
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,500
love did me in brother coppo it was love all alone

491
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:55,300
can you ask me...

492
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,600
sure lobo I can ask you a question

493
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,700
why are you doing this

494
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:04,766
looking at my face motionless 

495
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,866
looking into my eyes standing here

496
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,866
why are you investigating my murder

497
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:13,866
I can blame it on Kim

498
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,733
could deny my own agency

499
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:22,274
something about me is cynically hopeful though

500
00:27:22,983 --> 00:27:24,733
 in a contradictory sort of way 

501
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:29,700
i'm gonna say that it's leading me somewhere

502
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,266
or maybe i just want your fucking boots

503
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,200
something is on its way something hidden 

504
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,333
it's coming 

505
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:46,133
a miracle from the north west and it's almost here 

506
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,870
you can feel it in the air on your hands 

507
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,245
the cold spring air smoothing them over 

508
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:53,675
（选项：我的名字叫罗尼吗？）
fuck no you're no Roonie

509
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:56,266
fuck no you're no Roonie

510
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,466
the name is Raphael Ambrosius Costeau

511
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,766
listen to yourself

512
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,500
you're not a Raphael anything

513
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:10,700
you'll probably just harry or something that's right

514
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,566
harry

515
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,466
no no

516
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:15,826
I'm definitely Rafael

517
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:16,959
good for you

518
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:18,800
I hate you

519
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,600
I remind you of someone

520
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,333
a deep sea creature

521
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:26,100
not quite be fair now

522
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,533
a baby

523
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:31,100
you sure wriggled out of that one coppolini

524
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:33,684
 come back later coppo

525
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:37,900
amuse yourself with my frank manners 

526
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,688
and my memento mori features

527
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:48,215
if possible also see me in your dreams

528
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:50,266
oh my god

529
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,266
of course

530
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,162
you have questions don't you 

531
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,066
come back later cop

532
00:28:57,066 --> 00:29:00,766
are you sure we finish the preliminary examination of the cadaver 

533
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:03,533
we might miss some of these things once he's done

534
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,900
the cadaver slowly twists on the cargo belt...

535
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,433
the steel-reinforced belt presents a unique challenge 

536
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:13,700
I brought chain cutters 

537
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,658
but I don't see a good angle of approach to the belt

538
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,100
I'm pretty sure I got those chain cutters buddy

539
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,133
the cadaver is a good 1.2 metres up 

540
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:25,400
neither one of us can reach the belt without assistance 

541
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,733
and even if we do there's the question of cutting it

542
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:32,733
saw the branch let's not do it 

543
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,200
could shoot him down

544
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
maybe we can ask for help from the harbor

545
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:40,500
ah maybe we could saw the branch

546
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,900
climb up there and saw the branch

547
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:49,066
I don't trust that ladder the assailants didn't use it  

548
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,400
it's rotten and less sturdy than it looks

549
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:53,663
那他妈是怎么把他弄上去的
and I don't see another good way up there

550
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:53,989
and I don't see another good way up there

551
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:57,194
honestly I prefer a non-acrobatic solution to these 

552
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,666
clown cops climb tree fall down 

553
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,862
enraged cop assaults children after falling from tree

554
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:06,957
cretin cop they like that word saws the branch he's sitting on literally

555
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,566
你可太懂了
cretin cop they like that word saws the branch he's sitting on literally

556
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:11,386
cretin cop they like that word saws the branch he's sitting on literally

557
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:14,466
 local children report corpse mutilation

558
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:17,500
fuck yeah climb that shit monkeys

559
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:20,766
fuck you

560
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:23,066
C you're only making them do those things less

561
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:30,600
those kids bully us into not doing our work okay

562
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,667
yes we should us acrobatics as the very last option 

563
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,333
after we've tried everything normal

564
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:41,666
these have got to be the most fucking boring mulkkupaat I've ever seen

565
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:42,866
oh fuck off

566
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,300
can someone else do it

567
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,900
someone else you mean like the police

568
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,066
sadly yes the whole RCM is out there right now 

569
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:56,616
doing the exact same thing we are 

570
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:58,966
I know it's hard but I assure you

571
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:00,794
the others won't come to help us 

572
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:03,636
and we have a growing sanitary concern here 

573
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:06,244
we need to get him down fast

574
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,466
as you narrow your eyes 

575
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:11,519
the monster before you 

576
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,319
only the lower extremities are pink with a dash of blue 

577
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:17,399
his fatted hands thighs and his neck just above the noose 

578
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,633
（回chat）我没有枪！没枪怎么射！
his fatted hands thighs and his neck just above the noose 

579
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,633
his fatted hands thighs and his neck just above the noose 

580
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:26,432
the rest of the corpse appears dark green in the cold spring air 

581
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,266
（选项：我们重新谈谈怎么把他搞下来）

582
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,133
yes we do

583
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,566
yeah bang bang time pig shoot his head off 

584
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,400
how

585
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:39,566
to shoot the belt

586
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:43,466
yeah

587
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,000
yeah shoot the belt

588
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,400
it absolutely will not officer that's not how physics work 

589
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,566
it will maybe cut one thread loose

590
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:54,966
yeah now we're talkin' entertain the Cuno with some shit

591
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:57,733
they'll miss the pigs will miss Cuno

592
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,933
the lieutenant is undecided 

593
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:03,166
on one hand he wants to shoot some gun 

594
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,500
on the other it's an awfully stupid idea

595
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:12,000
let's get kim's

596
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,700
let's get his anxiety up

597
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,066
let me try alright Kim

598
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,366
let me give this a shot

599
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:22,203
lieutenant's brow is furrowed

600
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:24,666
 he appears too deep in concentration

601
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,066
take the shot lieutenant 

602
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,133
I blow his head off

603
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:29,236
take it take the shot

604
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:29,966
take it

605
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:32,600
take the shot Cuno wants some of that shit 

606
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,646
silence with his elbow sharp the lieutenant unzips his jacket  

607
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:39,294
fucking shoot that fucking guy down

608
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:41,702
and produces a lightweight firearm

609
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:44,766
he drops a paper cartridge in the barrel

610
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:49,233
 separates the scouring stick and gives the cartridge five tucks  

611
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,833
fucking do it kim let's go 

612
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:51,600
he then steps back 

613
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,100
and assumes the Falostesse position  taking aim  

614
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,081
the corner of his eye twitches his finger is on the trigger

615
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,333
（选项：把那个狗娘养的射下来）
the corner of his eye twitches his finger is on the trigger

616
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:01,066
he's gonna fucking mi

617
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:04,526
the kick voice is drowned in a shrill blast 

618
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:07,766
that echoes off the walls of the surrounding tenements 

619
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:11,206
a cloud of smoke slowly parts in the air 

620
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:14,466
as the lieutenant steps back and says to himself

621
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:15,666
god damn it

622
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,800
oh come on Kim 

623
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,566
he feels bad about it

624
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:23,933
about his eyes mostly just having bad eyesight properly from a young age 

625
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:27,400
whatever you do do not console him

626
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,600
fucking idiot

627
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,700
fuck

628
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
these fucking kids

629
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,700
Cuno could have hit it easy

630
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,468
but then Cuno is not fucking handicapped is he 

631
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:39,748
well give the fucking gun to the kid then

632
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,500
it said don't console him 

633
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,066
maybe I need to push Kim a little bit more okay

634
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,700
here's the thing 

635
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,800
Kim feels like he's been in charge this whole time 

636
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,800
he's like walking around like he has to baby me all right 

637
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,800
like he knows I'm not all there all the time 

638
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,666
and I think he's a little afraid to make his own decisions

639
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:05,600
I think I have to I

640
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,966
don't insult him

641
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,133
okay

642
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:11,666
we'll back it up 

643
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,366
I have to say it's beginning to look unlikely 

644
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:16,600
we can get him down without assistance

645
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:17,333
okay

646
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,300
I was really hoping we wouldn't 

647
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,966
the union appear to be suspect in this case 

648
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:24,333
it seems like a dangerous route to go down 

649
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,547
what then what the fuck are we supposed to do

650
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:30,800
okay they do have the tools and the men 

651
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,400
and since it looks like they put him there

652
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,766
but what are the options

653
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:43,333
the corpse twists on the belt like chicken on a skewer

654
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,533
maybe I should try with the gun 

655
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,266
I think you should give me the gun

656
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,366
it's bad as it is  us shooting firearms like punks 

657
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,100
go ahead i'm not stopping you

658
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,466
 just don't lose it

659
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:57,666
 yes give me the gun

660
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,800
they only have one gun

661
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:04,133
this is the sorriest pair of pigs Cunos ever seen

662
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:05,700
will you kids fucking scram

663
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,233
don't you have school 

664
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:10,200
where's the school in this fucking game

665
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:14,000
yeah take it you fucking banaanipoika

666
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,466
take it and shoot yourself in the mouth

667
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,300
fucking these fucking kids

668
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:21,721
feel the weight first

669
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:22,175
 the cold piece of bakelite and gunmetal is surprisingly light  

670
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:23,981
先熟悉熟悉这个东西
 the cold piece of bakelite and gunmetal is surprisingly light  

671
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:25,341
 the cold piece of bakelite and gunmetal is surprisingly light  

672
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,966
your fingers fit right through the guard 

673
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:30,733
instinctively resting on the trigger

674
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,566
I like the sound of that 

675
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,625
what the fuck are you waiting for Cuno 

676
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,616
tell him to shoot himself in the mouth

677
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,786
Cuno is silent 

678
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:39,666
aggression gathers in the air

679
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,527
the trigger feels delicate and ready to break under your finger

680
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,127
我要让这些小鬼看着
the trigger feels delicate and ready to break under your finger

681
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:43,154
the trigger feels delicate and ready to break under your finger

682
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:44,230
我要让小孩们见识
the trigger feels delicate and ready to break under your finger

683
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,666
我要让小孩们见识

684
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:45,054
我要让小孩们见识
I'll show Kim

685
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:45,666
I'll show Kim

686
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,666
I'll show the cadaver

687
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:47,766
I'll show everyone

688
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:48,585
the buckle comes into focus in your sights

689
00:35:48,585 --> 00:35:50,700
等着 看我是怎么做到的
the buckle comes into focus in your sights

690
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,366
you stand with your feet planted firmly in the ground 

691
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:56,866
and your left hand supporting your gun

692
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:58,933
my guy is probably basically sober by now

693
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:03,004
he's pointing it directly at his head 

694
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:05,500
it's gonna blow his head off isn't it

695
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,200
why don't you just shoot yourself in your mouth

696
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,200
at least you won't miss

697
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,900
I do want the kids I want to tell the kid to shut up 

698
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,933
I'm gonna do that but

699
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,366
do I close point the gun

700
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:26,033
I can point the gun at the kid

701
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,015
 I'm not gonna shoot the kid 

702
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:29,323
I gonna tell him to shut up though 

703
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,733
or what you're gonna fuck me

704
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:35,366
you want to fuck me pig is that what this is about 

705
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,666
what the fuck

706
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:42,900
and fuck it

707
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,966
boom got him 

708
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:54,766
the buckle explodes into tiny pieces coming loose with a whirr

709
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:55,900
what the fuck 

710
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,833
with your hand numb from the recoil 

711
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,600
you look have the body slump down 

712
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,966
for a moment the man appears to kneel in front of you

713
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:09,733
luckiest cop in the world

714
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,066
I don't know what's happening

715
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,600
looking straight at you 

716
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,300
helpless trapped within itself

717
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,666
who killed you 

718
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,700
communism

719
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,684
it takes a millisecond for the association to flash within your cortex 

720
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:30,598
you have no idea where it's coming from 

721
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:33,866
then the rigor in his muscles gives up 

722
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:37,300
and he smashes sideways into the spring mud

723
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,400
你被执法了

724
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,898
你被执法了
letting out a horrid stench

725
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:40,091
letting out a horrid stench

726
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:41,700
who's laughing at you little shit yeah

727
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,166
let's get those fucking kids back

728
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,933
fuck you kyrpale

729
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:48,047
you've been policed

730
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:49,100
（金：高击掌！）
you've been policed

731
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,116
（金：高击掌！）

732
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:51,066
yeah

733
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,066
take that one Kim

734
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:56,533
this is

735
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,900
I gotta I gotta give him a high five

736
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:05,349
fucking boom

737
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:10,310
the lieutenant takes a little hop to perform the customary salutation

738
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,466
your palm hurts from the slap

739
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:15,333
it's precise and down to the point 

740
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,663
I knew these guys were f****ts

741
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,900
i just can't ignore it 

742
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,900
we will perform a field autopsy and determine the cause of death

743
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,500
but before excuse me

744
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,200
the stanch is getting bad 

745
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,633
I'm sorry to interrupt the jubilations here 

746
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:36,533
I need a little breather before we do the autopsy

747
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:38,866
what field autopsy

748
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:41,066
yes the four phases of a murder scene

749
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:43,066
one investigation of the scene 

750
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,972
I can't say I'm satisfied with that part yet 

751
00:38:45,972 --> 00:38:48,606
I still want to know what's in that trash container

752
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,084
well we gotta check out the trash

753
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:51,871
two initial examination of the victim

754
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,016
we were pretty good in our efforts 

755
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,133
and the autopsy will provide another chance

756
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,766
i mean i basically did everything here so 

757
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:00,000
three field autopsy

758
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,465
this will not be pleasant or easy 

759
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,933
and it will have to be performed on the scene

760
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,500
what the fuck are they on about

761
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:10,000
are these fucking kids gonna watch us do that and comment on it as well

762
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,900
cops are gonna cut his shit up next

763
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,524
four and final transport of the coroner's case to the district morgue

764
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:18,166
 I'll do that 

765
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,366
god these things

766
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,866
don't we have a doctor 

767
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:23,533
you and I are detectives 

768
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:27,033
the honorary rank of detective signifies our ability 

769
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:29,466
to handle the entire incident chain 

770
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,933
from crime scene to autopsy to clean-up

771
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:33,838
we do it all

772
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,166
yeah I feel like a detective

773
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:38,299
your station would not have assigned you the case otherwise 

774
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:39,933
this case is important

775
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:43,133
alright you know what kim

776
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,343
can you hold the mean for now

777
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:48,033
we should try to interview Evrart Claier the leader of the union 

778
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:50,900
harbor property was clearly used in the hanging 

779
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,719
the harbor just east of here getting in might prove a challenge though 

780
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:00,263
or we could ask around for the representative of the logistics company 

781
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:02,582
my initial information say the wild pines

782
00:40:02,582 --> 00:40:05,582
 have sent some sort of strike negotiator

783
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:07,672
to wrangle control back from Evrart

784
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:13,266
yes and those were the interviewiees let's go

785
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:15,533
sensible decision okay

786
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,800
we've weaseled our way out of another crisis here 

787
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,333
make sure we save here check out that body now

788
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:30,042
the rotting man lies on his side

789
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:32,900
 with his eyes looking straight through you 

790
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:38,466
 lieutenant adjusts his glasses and takes a deep breath

791
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,866
we will come back to that

792
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,533
fuck does Cuno care

793
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,066
who is Cuno

794
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,866
Cuno's Cuno pig

795
00:40:56,066 --> 00:41:00,100
Cuno primal violent

796
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:03,990
I'm gonna do some verbal combat with this fucking kid 

797
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,033
bat with this fucking kid  

798
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,400
that went about as good as it could 

799
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,533
I don't know we're getting extremely lucky here

800
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:18,800
yeah think about it think about that rabid Cuno shit

801
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:22,700
he seems glad someone understood what he was going for 

802
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,000
but right as he's getting distracted 

803
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,200
you hear a malevolent hiss from behind the fence 

804
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,066

00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,466
I don't think anyone in this world would ever

811
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,088
no bystander is going to go out of their way 

812
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:55,933
to help someone in this disgusting environment

813
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,510
just answer the question 

814
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,180

00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:10,200

818
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,133
wait does this mean

819
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,500
does this mean hit him

820
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,666
I mean I have a forty two percent chance of succeeding

821
00:42:27,766 --> 00:42:30,466
should I give Cuno a smack I mean

822
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,466
what can I say give him hell yeah

823
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:37,566
after all this

824
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,266
okay I fail at that one 

825
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:48,600
I succeeded and running away from the bartender 

826
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,100
你没能让他闭嘴
I succeeded and running away from the bartender 

827
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,133
I succeeded and running away from the bartender 

828
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:52,938
your fat fist didn't meet its target 

829
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:56,471
instead it pulled you down with it 

830
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,843
I succeed at shooting the fucking guy down 

831
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:04,118
at scoping out the entire crime scene

832
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:05,974
 like I did all this intellectual shit 

833
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:11,275
but my guy is too fucked in his own body to like give a kid a slap

834
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,433
I mean checks out 

835
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:17,700
it's actually pretty consistent with my character

836
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:21,333
try to hold it together

837
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:25,566
pig's trying not to cry Cuno can't believe this shit 

838
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:27,766
can no one stop the Cuno

839
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,666
I can't stop the Cuno

840
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,331
that's the title of this video I can't stop the Cuno 

841
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:34,766
pig Cuno thought you had this

842
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:38,266
what happened Cuno can do anything now 

843
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,041
the whole charade was about to establishing dominance over you 

844
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,700
it's safe to say he has succeeded

845
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,800
I've been dominated by the Cuno

846
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,900
fuck your shoulder

847
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,866
fuck your knee

848
00:43:53,866 --> 00:43:55,733
fuck your fat body up

849
00:43:57,466 --> 00:43:58,266
ah

850
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,346
Kim get let's get Kim involved

851
00:44:03,346 --> 00:44:03,900
金：不。
Kim get let's get Kim involved

852
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,800
金：不。

853
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,766
why what you're not gonna help me

854
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,700
why did I give you the gun back

855
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,900
Kim you're supposed to be irresponsible for me here

856
00:44:14,466 --> 00:44:19,566
the creature behind the fence makes it a point to laugh even harder

857
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,366
Cuno made you his fuck gimp

858
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:27,266
my morale is just declining oh my god

859
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:30,066
the lieutenant isn't laughing at all

860
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,766
well then fucking help me up

861
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:37,966
just get back to it

862
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,366
unbelievable

863
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,200
Cuno beat the shit out of the popo

864
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,900
you didn't do anything

865
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:51,266
（坤诺：打断你的腿！）

866
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:53,533
（坤诺：打断你的腿！）
I brought this all on myself

867
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:57,033
I told you not to tempt such forces

868
00:44:57,033 --> 00:45:00,733
 now how about we go and do something worth the public's time

869
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,933
oh yeah you're gonna take the moral high ground

870
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:03,766
Kim okay well

871
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:06,166
let's leave these fucking kids to themselves

872
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:08,666
fuck out of here 

873
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:10,966
let's check out that dumpster first

874
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,350
this trash container is locked

875
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,585
我已经受够了自取其辱
this trash container is locked

876
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:16,289
我已经受够了自取其辱
the sliding lid has a padlock that says whirling in rags  

877
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:19,466
the sliding lid has a padlock that says whirling in rags  

878
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:25,133
there's something in there not necessarily connected to the case but still

879
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:28,127
 the body is downwind from here 

880
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:31,800
maybe you prefer the smell of garbage to the smell of death

881
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:34,766
trash food waste from the cafeteria

882
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:38,633
they lock these containers to keep the derelict from flocking in

883
00:45:38,633 --> 00:45:39,966
 could be evidence too

884
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:41,733
I feel like there's some evidence 

885
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:43,400
I mean we gotta get into that trash

886
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,566
what do you mean feel

887
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,100
it's just a hunch kim

888
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,793
we could try using a pry bar 

889
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:53,595
the one you took from my motor carriage or

890
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:56,433
or 

891
00:45:56,433 --> 00:46:00,233
or we could ask for a key from the manager of the whirling in rags 

892
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:01,500
he probably has one

893
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,500
this is a white check you may retry it

894
00:46:12,266 --> 00:46:14,033
my body is not very good 

895
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:16,833
it's 17 percent I don't want to tempt it 

896
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,866
I just failed a 42 percenter

897
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,866
let's look we'll try to get the key

898
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:25,480
so you said something about a white check 

899
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,600
how do I do those

900
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:30,133
how do I retry them or whatever

901
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,766
what do I need to do here

902
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:37,300
god damn we have a lot of quests there are tasks

903
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:41,966
check the map

904
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,400
so what do I do

905
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,466
like these ones

906
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:14,886
oh I can try it again 

907
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,900
so meaning I should just try this anyways right

908
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,722
force time isn't happening

909
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,469
you've jammed the pry bar under the lid 

910
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,629
but it just isn't bending 

911
00:47:26,629 --> 00:47:28,266
what is this

912
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,092
your triceps ache for the metal to bend but it resists 

913
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:37,427
this calls for a potent curse help break it's resistance

914
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:41,282
utter the POWER WORDS

915
00:47:41,282 --> 00:47:44,601
the FUCK kind of metal is this this is fucking SHIT

916
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:52,700
I could complain I could kick it or 

917
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,233
I could try harder that doesn't seem like 

918
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:56,300
I think complaining is more inspirator

919
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,533
金：金属的质量没有问题
I think complaining is more inspirator

920
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:58,250
金：金属的质量没有问题

921
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:58,450
金：金属的质量没有问题
from what I see it's sturdy enough

922
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,766
from what I see it's sturdy enough

923
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:05,033
he's enjoying your little failure he finds it amusing  

924
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:07,905
he's reveling in the sweaty rage on your face

925
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:09,266
god damn it god damn it 

926
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:11,700
now what I've done is I've lost all of kim's respect 

927
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,668
after I did that fucking sick thing where I shot the guy down 

928
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,233
and I scoped out the entire crime scene 

929
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:20,366
now I can't do simple shit like

930
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,100
like like

931
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,100
hit a stupid kid or open a trash can

932
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:29,933
my character is a failure at the most important things

933
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,800
let's ask the manager for the key

934
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,733
oh fuck this

935
00:48:37,933 --> 00:48:39,566
the letter r is crown

936
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,161
let's get the fuck out of here

937
00:48:43,161 --> 00:48:46,800
I don't care about owning that kid anyways

938
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:58,066
so meaning I could probably try and go get my thing back

939
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:01,166
a broken window

940
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,966
could probably try to get my

941
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:08,300
my tie

942
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:12,666
okay what are the things I'm really failing at here 

943
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,300
threaten people 

944
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,600
do I want to be threatening no I don't think so 

945
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,000
I think my body just needs some kind of attention

946
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,066
pick locks and pockets that's pretty cool

947
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,733
sneak under their noses

948
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,966
see hear and smell everything

949
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,766
I feel like failing at physical stuff yeah

950
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,699
my physique is like not even that bad 

951
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:47,466
it's my motor that's pretty bad

952
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,466
I feel like reaction speed is probably pretty important

953
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,966
physical instrument

954
00:50:05,566 --> 00:50:06,533
what is this

955
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,600
lie

956
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,933
see the art

957
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:29,800
enables you to take what others don't notice 

958
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,400
the little wad of bills hid away in the sugar bowl

959
00:50:34,566 --> 00:50:36,800
takes in the final detail of the physical world

960
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:41,733
that's what i really want is 

961
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:45,566
to be very perceptive of people in the environment 

962
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:49,066
but a failure to actually do anything about it

963
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,200
like observation skills 

964
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,300
like that's the failed therapist in him like

965
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,466
he's trained to spot people and detect everything

966
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,133
but he can't exert his agency on anything 

967
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:06,466
because he's just a failure of a human

968
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,300
shivers what is shivers

969
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,900
tune into the city

970
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,200
shivers comes when the temperature drops 

971
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,463
and you become more keenly aware of your surroundings 

972
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:20,137
enables you to hear the city itself 

973
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:21,904
to truly belong to the streets 

974
00:51:22,098 --> 00:51:23,664
it's a supernatural ability 

975
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,066
old wrongs play out in present time

976
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:27,700
scenes across the city happened in front of you

977
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,000
but who is speaking to you 

978
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,166
at high level shivers may make you seem mad to the outside world

979
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,162
seldom hear the city

980
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:39,491
speaking to you it does seem pretty cool 

981
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:41,639
and it does go alongside inland empire 

982
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:45,005
as like a magical intuition

983
00:51:49,743 --> 00:51:51,266
street wise

984
00:51:54,466 --> 00:51:56,100
but I kind of want to be a 

985
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,566
I'll probably speck into shivers as well

986
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,666
got zero in this 

987
00:52:03,378 --> 00:52:07,000
it urges you to be better than you are 

988
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,600
that's probably nothing

989
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:13,378
you can drop one in shivers

990
00:52:15,518 --> 00:52:16,706
if you enjoy good writing

991
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:19,206
let's do it drop one shivers

992
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,033
okay we've got a lot of stuff  we can do here  

993
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:29,666
find smokes and smoke them that's that's a priority

994
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,933
track down my badge

995
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,133
track down my gun 

996
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:37,666
I kind of do feel like having my gun would be a good idea

997
00:52:40,566 --> 00:52:41,600
what was that other one

998
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:43,700
ah yeah

999
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,600
I should get briefed by Kim on the case

1000
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,400
yes

1001
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:48,516
tell me about the case

1002
00:52:48,516 --> 00:52:49,449
what do you want to know

1003
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,621
 literally anything I can't remember a single thing  

1004
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:55,350
ah yes okay the case brief you missed now I remember

1005
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:59,763
 three days ago the RCM Emergencies Desk received a report

1006
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:02,982
about a security guard who was found hanged in Martinaise

1007
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,100
an anonymous caller said 

1008
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,397
there was a dead body behind the whirling in rag's hostle cafeteria 

1009
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,466
the cadaver had been there for four days

1010
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,320
no one had come to investigate

1011
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:15,450
during that time

1012
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:18,533
the victim had been stripped of his belongings

1013
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:22,366
the caller did not identify him but used the word lynching 

1014
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,367
there is an ongoing labor dispute 

1015
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:28,566
between the local dockworkers and the logistics company Wilde Pines  

1016
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:32,066
I was told we should approach the death as part of this dispute 

1017
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:41,266
they didn't identify themselves in any way 

1018
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:44,366
the tone was muffled using a device of some sort 

1019
00:53:44,366 --> 00:53:47,800
the desk could identify neither the caller's age nor sex 

1020
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,200
there's a strong prejudice against involving the RCM 

1021
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,424
in what's seen as the union matters 

1022
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:57,703
the dockworkers union is the de facto police in Martinaise 

1023
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:01,061
now it appears they've started executing too 

1024
00:54:01,061 --> 00:54:02,701
we cannot allow that 

1025
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:04,076
and the RCM is

1026
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:06,314
that's us the Revachol Citizens Militia

1027
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:08,500
we're the police in this city

1028
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:15,466
we're here to find the killer

1029
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,100
why are we on the same place

1030
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,966
you and I are pawns in a pissing competition

1031
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,100
yeah tell me who's really pulling the strings here

1032
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,066
his disdain is clear 

1033
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:35,033
this man would not use such an expression otherwise 

1034
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:35,733
金：你不知道？
go deeper

1035
00:54:36,766 --> 00:54:38,666
I assumed you were in on it

1036
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,328
I don't remember being in on anything 

1037
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:43,804
you know what I'm in on retrograde amnesia

1038
00:54:44,736 --> 00:54:46,466
 that's for me not for Kim

1039
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:47,600
what's there to say

1040
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:49,366
it's just stupidity

1041
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:51,766
keep it going

1042
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:54,204
our precincts can't decide if Martinaise is 

1043
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:56,966
part of Jamrock or the Industrial Harbor

1044
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,445
yours or mine 

1045
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,233
as if we somehow own parts of the city 

1046
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:03,466
typical street gang mentality

1047
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,041
so we've let the union make a mockery of law enforcement here 

1048
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,808
and now it's come to its natural conclusion 

1049
00:55:10,033 --> 00:55:11,358
well sort of

1050
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:15,471
 it's less a matter of who gets to police Martinaise than who has to 

1051
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:17,872
it's an orphan district in other words 

1052
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:22,071
I think the dispatch desk just told both our stations about the hanging 

1053
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:25,654
there was quite the brouhaha at 57th I can tell you that

1054
00:55:26,392 --> 00:55:29,157
time to settle it they said Cop Off

1055
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:33,675
but I assure you I am not their finest or toughest 

1056
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:35,898
with 102 cases solved 

1057
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:39,168
what I am is least interested in a pissing competition

1058
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:43,066
so he volunteered to represent the 57th

1059
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:45,277
but not out of competitiveness 

1060
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:47,066
on the contrary

1061
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:50,600
good reaction speed there

1062
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,866
so you volunteered to spoil it

1063
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,800
we've got a motivation here

1064
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,900
I'm an unrepentant spoilsport

1065
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,200
I'm the finest case solving machine 

1066
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,800
sent to outperform you in every way imaginable

1067
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,000
hmm

1068
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:18,133
I feel like I have a lot of ground to make up with with Kim 

1069
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:20,659
because I really sufficiently embarrassed myself 

1070
00:56:20,659 --> 00:56:24,300
with that trash can and losing to Cuno so

1071
00:56:25,866 --> 00:56:27,966
I don't want to also come off as a

1072
00:56:30,466 --> 00:56:32,133
close minded are uninsightful

1073
00:56:35,966 --> 00:56:38,200
I probably have an unbelievable kill count

1074
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:45,200
an apocalyptic omen sent by my people

1075
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:49,169
I'm gonna leave why I was sent unspecified 

1076
00:56:49,169 --> 00:56:50,933
the silence carries

1077
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:53,800
Martinez nothing

1078
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,700
it's just a pedal at the end of some drain pipe 

1079
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,708
no one cares about this place they care about spots  

1080
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:02,636
most of our colleagues don't even know how to get here 

1081
00:57:02,636 --> 00:57:04,977
north of the interchange doesn't exist 

1082
00:57:04,977 --> 00:57:07,000
a tremble comes over you

1083
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,433
哦 天人感应来了
another after-effect of ethanol poisoning perhaps 

1084
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:10,666
another after-effect of ethanol poisoning perhaps 

1085
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:13,903
feels like leaves do when they rustle in the breeze 

1086
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:17,400
somewhere far away below the turbine

1087
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:19,858
the 41st and the 57th

1088
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:21,778
the lieutenant was right

1089
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,966
it's not about who gets what's north

1090
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:26,909
it's about who doesn't

1091
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:30,566
okay shivers is fucking good

1092
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:35,451
yes it's a wholly pointless matter 

1093
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:37,401
forget I ever mentioned it

1094
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,000
what I like about that is it yeah

1095
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,700
it's like an intuitive sort of like

1096
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:47,133
grasp on the bigger picture

1097
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:50,866
like who benefits

1098
00:57:50,866 --> 00:57:52,133
who doesn't benefit

1099
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,100
he's actually glad it's addressed now 

1100
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:01,300
three percent chance

1101
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:07,966
uh let's go for it

1102
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,744
because you're the best qualified 

1103
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:11,266
那肯定不是

1104
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:11,774
那肯定不是
no that doesn't seem right

1105
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:13,000
no that doesn't seem right

1106
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,917
I'm exceedingly well

1107
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:21,333
why can't you remember why you were sent  

1108
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,200
anyway don't keep the lieutenant waiting

1109
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:29,766
okay

1110
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,966
we'll find out more about Kim as we go along

1111
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:38,800
ask this lady what's up

1112
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:45,000
the RCM in matinez what can I help you with

1113
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,097
shivers as cool as it is implied to be a paranormal intuition 

1114
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:52,898
上面另有条chat个人很喜欢，说天人感应是Outland Empire
shivers as cool as it is implied to be a paranormal intuition 

1115
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:53,734
but you can sign it away as 

1116
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:53,933
译注：反常扭曲-parataxic distortion，心理学概念， 指个体将过去的人际关系和 情感模式投射到当前情境中 ，对他人和事件产生不切实 的感知和反应。
but you can sign it away as 

1117
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,933
译注：反常扭曲-parataxic distortion，心理学概念， 指个体将过去的人际关系和 情感模式投射到当前情境中 ，对他人和事件产生不切实 的感知和反应。
just being literally the definition of a parataxic distortion

1118
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:57,900
译注：反常扭曲-parataxic distortion，心理学概念， 指个体将过去的人际关系和 情感模式投射到当前情境中 ，对他人和事件产生不切实 的感知和反应。

1119
00:58:58,466 --> 00:58:59,466
it seems like

1120
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,400
not too many things you discover through shivers

1121
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,666
may matter of decisions

1122
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:08,382
but it definitely gives you a lot of like worldly context 

1123
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,686
or maybe that's wrong 

1124
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:14,366
can raise your chances if you explore other dialogue options

1125
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:17,066
the check is locked because you didn't

1126
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:20,566
oh okay

1127
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,733
so I should have talked with him about some other things first

1128
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:26,966
of course

1129
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:29,133
what can I help you with

1130
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,766
can I borrow your gloves

1131
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:32,333
I'm doing an autopsy

1132
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:36,066
that's a little direct

1133
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:39,466
of course where to 

1134
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,766
wild pines you mean the company woman

1135
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:46,066
yes a representative of the Harbor 

1136
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:48,600
she should have set up operations nearby

1137
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,400
oh

1138
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:52,466
that must be the woman on the giant boat 

1139
00:59:53,266 --> 00:59:55,207
there's one docked on the pier 

1140
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,895
it arrived a couple of weeks ago 

1141
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,748
it's very hard to miss

1142
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:01,266
okay

1143
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,066
where am I

1144
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:05,949
just tell me where we are

1145
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:07,382
we are in Martinaise sir

1146
01:00:07,382 --> 01:00:11,510
this intersection is called roundabout north I think 

1147
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:11,549
 there's the pier

1148
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:12,599
（选项：北边有什么？）
 there's the pier

1149
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:12,933
 there's the pier

1150
01:00:12,966 --> 01:00:15,088
the capeside apartment buildings

1151
01:00:15,088 --> 01:00:17,988
 some more tenements not a lot really 

1152
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,578
（选项：东边有什么？）
the hobbergates some kind of commotion I think

1153
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:22,316
the hobbergates some kind of commotion I think

1154
01:00:22,316 --> 01:00:24,566
I don't follow the local politics

1155
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,272
（选项：南边有什么？）
some shops and the bridge 

1156
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:26,633
some shops and the bridge 

1157
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:28,740
the Canal bridge leads to the coast 

1158
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,997
but it's broken I think 

1159
01:00:30,997 --> 01:00:33,166
some kind of accident probably 

1160
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:33,200
（选项：运河的另一边有什么？）
some kind of accident probably 

1161
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,066
（选项：运河的另一边有什么？）
just coast 

1162
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:37,200
there's a little fishing village there 

1163
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,633
and a fish market 

1164
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:41,333
but that got closed down ages ago

1165
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,200
rows of stalls under a broad roof 

1166
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,633
where silvery fish were heaped on newspapers 

1167
01:00:47,633 --> 01:00:51,007
water water everywhere pouring from the heavens

1168
01:00:51,007 --> 01:00:53,700
in the shadow of the old church 

1169
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,200
there is just like good writing hidden in that skill isn't there

1170
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,132
what kind of fish market

1171
01:01:02,366 --> 01:01:04,466
it's just water no

1172
01:01:04,466 --> 01:01:08,166
actually I think they call it the Martinaise inlet 

1173
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:12,063
there are some islands in the bay but they're hard to reach

1174
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:13,866
 all right

1175
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:16,077
let's ask her for our gloves 

1176
01:01:16,493 --> 01:01:21,461
wow sure keep them i have another pair 

1177
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:24,066
okay I'll take him

1178
01:01:24,066 --> 01:01:25,423
（选项：你到底是谁？）
 me I am just a gardener 

1179
01:01:25,423 --> 01:01:27,066
 me I am just a gardener 

1180
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:28,766
（选项：那你在这里做什么？）
I am working

1181
01:01:29,244 --> 01:01:29,685
（选项：做什么工作？）

1182
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:30,276
（选项：做什么工作？）
I have a greenhouse in the yard there

1183
01:01:30,276 --> 01:01:31,866
I have a greenhouse in the yard there

1184
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,041
I've been trying to get some work done

1185
01:01:35,351 --> 01:01:38,679
there's discomfort she stops mid sentence 

1186
01:01:39,131 --> 01:01:42,587
well as you probably know 

1187
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:45,059
there's a corpse hanging from a tree there 

1188
01:01:45,412 --> 01:01:48,693
it smells pretty bad so I have to take breaks

1189
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:51,259
don't worry miss we are here to clean it up

1190
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,659
you can get to work soon

1191
01:01:54,287 --> 01:01:55,356
thank you

1192
01:01:55,669 --> 01:01:59,700
 down do you mean the body is finally gone

1193
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:01,466
oh

1194
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,600
we just left it on the ground

1195
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:05,770
can you tell me when you've taken him away then 

1196
01:02:06,436 --> 01:02:11,290
no do not report back to this random civilian about anything

1197
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,866
yeah exactly

1198
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:13,717
why would I do that 

1199
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,614
this is why I became a cop god damn it 

1200
01:02:16,614 --> 01:02:19,198
so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself 

1201
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:20,765
see you around officer 

1202
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:23,566
thanks for the gloves miss 

1203
01:02:23,566 --> 01:02:26,700
I'll put them to good work let's put those on

1204
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:34,366
all right we got another skill point here

1205
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:38,966
drama this is about lying to people 

1206
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:41,066
treat the world as a stage 

1207
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:44,900
lie concoct the most elaborate and wonderful stories 

1208
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,600
render you an insufferable thespian

1209
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,900
I can't lie or discern when others lie

1210
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,866
that's pretty good I don't know if I want to do a lot of lying

1211
01:02:55,866 --> 01:02:57,966
but I need to know if other people are lying

1212
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,333
authority makes itself seem very reasonable you've got a good point 

1213
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,500
where is authority

1214
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:16,566
assert and reassert your dominance over those around you

1215
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:19,666
become William Shakespeare

1216
01:03:21,766 --> 01:03:23,166
demands respect

1217
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,700
hey what's up kraith

1218
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:33,066
I kind of want to take a point in drama

1219
01:03:34,866 --> 01:03:36,466
if they lie you'll know immediately 

1220
01:03:36,466 --> 01:03:38,733
I want to be able to call people out on their shit

1221
01:03:41,966 --> 01:03:42,319
definitely a Respect Junkie yeah so far

1222
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,466
译注："Respect Junkie" （未想出恰当中译）指的是 一种极度渴望他人尊重的人 。特征：过度追求认可、低 自尊、表现欲强、敏感脆弱 ，甚至可能做出一些夸张或 极端的行为来引起注意和获 得他人的肯定。
definitely a Respect Junkie yeah so far

1224
01:03:49,466 --> 01:03:51,900
both can sus out lies okay well

1225
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,900
then maybe I expect more into empathy 

1226
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,100
it was volition

1227
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,666
to be a good guy well

1228
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:00,908
that's probably not what I'm going for 

1229
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:02,466
how's the gaming going it's going

1230
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,880
it's good there's some ups and downs 

1231
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,379
my guy is exceptionally good at certain things 

1232
01:04:08,379 --> 01:04:11,866
and really bad at much simpler things

1233
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,066
halflight is your fight or flight response

1234
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:18,533
sense the ways situations are about to turn

1235
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:23,166
ultra attuned to the world around you

1236
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,333
the Cuno happened yeah

1237
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,733
I got beat up by a kid

1238
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:35,600
I tried to hit up the kid and I fell on the ground 

1239
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,500
and not only did the kid laugh at me 

1240
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,200
but I lost kim's respect as well

1241
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,485
then I tried to open a trash can and my guy was too weak 

1242
01:04:43,268 --> 01:04:48,945
but I made a pinpoint laser shot to knock the body down 

1243
01:04:48,945 --> 01:04:51,366
with a fucking pistol

1244
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,733
have a zero in this 

1245
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,800
I don't have a zero in anything else

1246
01:05:07,266 --> 01:05:11,456
at low levels you'll be bumbling freckless cop unable to catch a pair of keys 

1247
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:13,400
see this is what I'm missing 

1248
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:17,132
I can't be bumbling way way through the world like this 

1249
01:05:17,132 --> 01:05:19,168
I got to put a point into this right

1250
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,400
I do count this as a win

1251
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,900
let's put something in that

1252
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:34,100
I can't just like go around like

1253
01:05:34,906 --> 01:05:38,693
 I'm traumatized by like losing that battle to Cuno 

1254
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:42,031
I think this would have probably made a big difference 

1255
01:05:42,613 --> 01:05:44,800
I want to be persuasive

1256
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,266
but I also want to be cool

1257
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,400
okay so it sounded like where you're to go north

1258
01:06:00,066 --> 01:06:01,533
to the pier

1259
01:06:01,966 --> 01:06:04,266
welcome to Revachol

1260
01:06:07,933 --> 01:06:09,133
he doesn't even talk to me

1261
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:11,941
（选项：你为什么要那样针对我的搭档）

1262
01:06:11,941 --> 01:06:13,325
（选项：你为什么要那样针对我的搭档）
don't you welcome to Revachol me

1263
01:06:13,325 --> 01:06:13,866
don't you welcome to Revachol me

1264
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:19,466
my grandfather came here from a 3000 year old racist isolationist culture

1265
01:06:19,466 --> 01:06:23,800
 while your ancestors came to this island a mere 300 years ago

1266
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:28,971
every school of thought and government has failed in this city 

1267
01:06:28,971 --> 01:06:31,085
but I love it nonetheless 

1268
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:34,335
it belongs to me as much as it belongs to you

1269
01:06:34,942 --> 01:06:36,600
jeez Kim is getting deep here

1270
01:06:36,966 --> 01:06:39,666
it's men like you who keep Revachol divided 

1271
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:42,000
making it that much harder for everyone 

1272
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,100
to climb out of this post war limbo

1273
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,100
oh come on man I just said welcome to Revachol 

1274
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,371
it's a lorry driver thing

1275
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:55,133
racist lorry driver

1276
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:56,966
I know exactly what you meant 

1277
01:06:57,566 --> 01:07:00,658
you think my kind doesn't belong here 

1278
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:04,533
that I should watch myself and behave 

1279
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:07,280
but you see I'm an officer of the RCM

1280
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,663
 it's actually my job to make sure you behave 

1281
01:07:11,696 --> 01:07:15,354
silence the air between them become tense

1282
01:07:15,354 --> 01:07:19,357
maybe I should give the fucking crowbar over to Kim

1283
01:07:19,357 --> 01:07:23,163
 your partner needs backup now's your moment to shine

1284
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,106
fucking yeah I've got your back 

1285
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:28,711
I've got your back Kim

1286
01:07:30,533 --> 01:07:35,100
he Kim is really the muscle of our little duo here

1287
01:07:39,933 --> 01:07:43,160
you do make a cute couple you know that 

1288
01:07:43,551 --> 01:07:48,191
the lieutenant exhales and resumes his regular calmness 

1289
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:49,983
把他关起来 金

1290
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:50,863
把他关起来 金
whatever you say officer

1291
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:52,150
等会 我们等会儿再对付这个傻大个
whatever you say officer

1292
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,046
等会 我们等会儿再对付这个傻大个

1293
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:57,292
you could ask him to show you the soles of his boots 

1294
01:07:57,722 --> 01:08:00,962
he definitely looks like someone capable of a lynching 

1295
01:08:00,962 --> 01:08:03,133
maybe he was present

1296
01:08:03,133 --> 01:08:05,266
yeah that's a good point authority

1297
01:08:08,733 --> 01:08:09,600
got a smoke

1298
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,400
nope

1299
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,250
he's got a smoke right there in his fucking hand 

1300
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,906
snatch that shit out of his fat fingers

1301
01:08:17,566 --> 01:08:19,666
need after listening to his garbage

1302
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:21,400
you're smoking one right now

1303
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,666
it's my last one

1304
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:26,066
you hiding some smoke

1305
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:28,666
could I do that I'm an honest man 

1306
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,000
look I'm the one with a fucking crowbar all right

1307
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,166
give me a smoke

1308
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,466
what officer

1309
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:44,898
sorry I couldn't be off any help

1310
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:51,400
what's that argument all about

1311
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,142
it's about biological detaminism

1312
01:08:54,142 --> 01:08:57,141
natural law the sorting of the races

1313
01:08:57,141 --> 01:09:00,200
not the most popular topic nowadays

1314
01:09:00,216 --> 01:09:03,249
with the coalition in charge and all 

1315
01:09:03,249 --> 01:09:06,133
you might want to change the topic

1316
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:09,900
that is bury your head under the sand like come on sheep

1317
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:11,637
change the topic 

1318
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:15,933
the way he says it makes it almost sound like a threat

1319
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,766
oh so you're just a racist makes sense

1320
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,766
yeah a cigarette hoarding racist

1321
01:09:23,766 --> 01:09:25,900
I'm not just racist look

1322
01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:27,333
I've read books

1323
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:30,977
the science of racial theory has all been proved 

1324
01:09:30,977 --> 01:09:34,566
even if some people don't want to accept it

1325
01:09:34,933 --> 01:09:36,566
hey what's up masters

1326
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,466
welcome to the stream

1327
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:39,394
yeah it's been a long time since we've seen you around 

1328
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:42,533
it's been pretty interesting so far

1329
01:09:43,766 --> 01:09:46,089
people who've studied these things said that

1330
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:49,800
 you and me are superior by desire

1331
01:09:49,933 --> 01:09:51,687
so naturally

1332
01:09:52,066 --> 01:09:54,533
we Occidentals should be in charge 

1333
01:09:54,533 --> 01:09:57,500
obviously you can see the merits in that

1334
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,400
well man what's blowing my mind is like 

1335
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,666
every character that I've stumbled across

1336
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:05,703
which has been like four or five of them 

1337
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:10,633
has like so much to say and so much to react to 

1338
01:10:11,692 --> 01:10:15,700
and just really deepens the environment that I'm in

1339
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:21,206
I haven't walked more than a couple meters in any direction in this game

1340
01:10:21,206 --> 01:10:29,866
 and I feel like I've been sucked into like this whole infinite possible world

1341
01:10:29,866 --> 01:10:30,766
 it's crazy

1342
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:34,566
even some fucking fat fingered cigarette hoarding 

1343
01:10:34,566 --> 01:10:37,266
racist has a lot of interesting things to say

1344
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:41,277
open your eyes 

1345
01:10:41,277 --> 01:10:43,873
haven't you noticed something different lately 

1346
01:10:44,144 --> 01:10:46,502
an unfortunate downturn maybe

1347
01:10:46,502 --> 01:10:49,244
when members of the superior race cease to 

1348
01:10:49,244 --> 01:10:51,810
believe in their innate superiority

1349
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:54,744
they stop competing for resources

1350
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,200
okay and 

1351
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,533
this concerns you policeman so you better be vigilant 

1352
01:11:00,533 --> 01:11:03,500
the damn kipts are showing up good lately 

1353
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,966
same with the mesquitos and the other introduced species too 

1354
01:11:07,966 --> 01:11:11,400
they're on the precipice of cultural victory

1355
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:14,797
（选项：这个文化胜利是什么意思？）
it's what the kipts of boogie street are going for 

1356
01:11:14,797 --> 01:11:16,427
it's what the kipts of boogie street are going for 

1357
01:11:16,427 --> 01:11:18,731
right under our noses 

1358
01:11:18,731 --> 01:11:20,204
and the others too 

1359
01:11:20,204 --> 01:11:24,266
on the radio heard any chanson lately

1360
01:11:24,266 --> 01:11:27,799
heard any mottettos or lieder no 

1361
01:11:28,073 --> 01:11:31,966
dominating culture is how they plan to win

1362
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:33,800
they say so themselves

1363
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:35,066
it's who

1364
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:38,933
also you need to realize the dangers of mixing races 

1365
01:11:39,309 --> 01:11:40,866
who knows what might happen

1366
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,800
if people don't stay in their birth place 

1367
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,100
you might end up with a new sub race with the new characteristics 

1368
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,966
leading to extra competition 

1369
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:53,000
that's why you've got to control the offspring

1370
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,666
yeah I think I can get down with racism

1371
01:11:57,266 --> 01:11:58,066
fuck

1372
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,066
yeah I'm not down with this 

1373
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:03,066
why don't you go fuck yourself there we go

1374
01:12:03,066 --> 01:12:04,997
don't push your luck runt

1375
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,900
let that be where it is 

1376
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,133
let's check out that trash can though

1377
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:19,533
probably need to drink some of that magnesium

1378
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,900
gotta I gotta heal up

1379
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,200
can I go in here

1380
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,100
wanted to be a dirty cop I do not a racist cop

1381
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,261
you see several packaged raincoats fill a low shelf 

1382
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:44,923
beneath a display of croissants and juice bottles 

1383
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:50,466
the raincoats are transparent except for the big FRITTTE slogan on the back

1384
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,600
what is that is what 

1385
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,733
uhm it's a raincoat

1386
01:12:58,117 --> 01:13:00,775
why is she so snippy she's snippy already

1387
01:13:00,775 --> 01:13:03,566
if you want to buy one then it's only 4 Real

1388
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:07,552
I don't have that I don't have shit 

1389
01:13:07,552 --> 01:13:10,533
I got less than one Real

1390
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:12,826
the tear machine stands in the corner

1391
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:16,478
 a sign says one bottle equals ten cents 

1392
01:13:16,478 --> 01:13:19,866
hmm oh that's the tare machine

1393
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,621
（选项：是啊 但到底是*做什么*的）
it's a machine for tare

1394
01:13:21,621 --> 01:13:23,166
it's a machine for tare

1395
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:27,714
you know you find tare outside like bottles or whatever 

1396
01:13:27,714 --> 01:13:30,866
and put it in the machine then it gives you money 

1397
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:32,923
you need a bag I guess 

1398
01:13:32,923 --> 01:13:36,522
we used to have some but we gave them all out so 

1399
01:13:36,522 --> 01:13:39,037
feel free to use it if you find a bag though

1400
01:13:39,037 --> 01:13:41,866
I'm sure there are some out there

1401
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:43,366
somewhere

1402
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,100
okay so I need to get a bag 

1403
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,171
so that I can pick up some bottles in the trash 

1404
01:13:47,171 --> 01:13:48,893
so I can turn them into this thing

1405
01:13:48,893 --> 01:13:52,400
 and then I can buy some sigs that's what I gotta do

1406
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:56,100
that's what I gotta do right now

1407
01:13:59,466 --> 01:14:00,713
what's all this then

1408
01:14:00,713 --> 01:14:03,366
okay bunch of rioting bullshit

1409
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,766
not my focus I my guy

1410
01:14:06,766 --> 01:14:08,429
look I've been putting my brain behind...

1411
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:11,666
oh this guy's got a cigarette it's got a sig

1412
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,575
I am a gander and a hunter and a gatherer

1413
01:14:17,314 --> 01:14:19,818
feel like a traveller

1414
01:14:21,566 --> 01:14:22,270
what's going on here

1415
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,132
it's the jam my man

1416
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:26,466
it's a traffic jam for the ages

1417
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:28,805
 harbour gates up the street are shut tight 

1418
01:14:29,066 --> 01:14:30,533
no explanation given 

1419
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:35,129
workers on strike scabs agitatin' and all around clusterfuck 

1420
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:38,143
meanwhile we're all stuck here in long haul limbo 

1421
01:14:38,143 --> 01:14:41,354
for days upon days upon days

1422
01:14:42,215 --> 01:14:43,468
  limbo huh 

1423
01:14:44,933 --> 01:14:46,012
so how long you've been here 

1424
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,466
feels like forever

1425
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:52,942
like I was born on this here roundabout

1426
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:55,750
just me and the metal and the tires

1427
01:14:55,766 --> 01:14:57,600
the oil and the fumes of mazut

1428
01:15:01,466 --> 01:15:04,500
can you say it again only a little less plodding 

1429
01:15:08,366 --> 01:15:11,033
I look I like this guy I don't want to put him off 

1430
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,534
I'm still trying to get that cigarette right out of his hand 

1431
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:15,700
I'm just gonna praise him

1432
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,062
yeah imagine it's been a whole week already 

1433
01:15:18,062 --> 01:15:20,025
behind the laugh however

1434
01:15:20,366 --> 01:15:21,900
a touch of sorrow 

1435
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,417
is that empathy coming out

1436
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:25,119
so tell me what do you need

1437
01:15:25,318 --> 01:15:26,666
 how about a cigarette

1438
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:28,166
nope don't smoke

1439
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,426
he's smoking 

1440
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:33,383
some of the other drivers do though 

1441
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:35,909
他明明正在抽烟！！！
there's still a few around waiting for the jam to disperse

1442
01:15:35,909 --> 01:15:37,066
there's still a few around waiting for the jam to disperse

1443
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,733
or waiting for the sweet release of death

1444
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:41,526
he's literally smoking a cigarette

1445
01:15:41,526 --> 01:15:43,875
yup nothing wrong with that statement 

1446
01:15:44,225 --> 01:15:46,166
your senses have nothing to add 

1447
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,318
you'll have to ask around elsewhere

1448
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:56,533
was actually born and spent his whole virtual life in this roundabout true

1449
01:15:56,533 --> 01:15:59,143
you could also check the kiosk down the street 

1450
01:15:59,143 --> 01:16:01,913
Frittte with three t-s

1451
01:16:02,733 --> 01:16:03,966
Revachol is weird

1452
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,900
see anything about the dead guy

1453
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,258
....I know that all accounted for

1454
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:15,195
 otherwise I haven't really asked about that 

1455
01:16:15,508 --> 01:16:17,840
been wastin' time right here keepin' busy

1456
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,437
the reason he didn't give me a cigarette

1457
01:16:22,437 --> 01:16:23,358
is because I could 

1458
01:16:23,808 --> 01:16:27,918
technically I couldn't perceive the one in his fucking hand

1459
01:16:34,133 --> 01:16:37,392
analyzing the fundamental structural and psychological conditions

1460
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:40,512
of being stranded in the midst of a sea of motor lorries

1461
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,200
and their sad despondent chauffeurs 

1462
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:48,100
a sense of surprise there ain't more bodies hanging from more trees 

1463
01:16:50,966 --> 01:16:53,333
I mean he's got a certain way of looking at the world

1464
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,033
it's like whatever's going on over at the docks 

1465
01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:58,366
workers got a blockade set up

1466
01:16:58,466 --> 01:16:59,533
making demands 

1467
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:01,242
no way in or out 

1468
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,929
（选项：所以他们有什么要求？）
some pretty wild stuff I hear 

1469
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,433
like a giant new power crane in half the company 

1470
01:17:06,433 --> 01:17:07,766
forget what exactly

1471
01:17:07,766 --> 01:17:10,630
I've heard talk there's a company rep in town too 

1472
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:12,901
like a strike negotiator type

1473
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:14,566
they know what's up

1474
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:16,900
precise demands and so on

1475
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:21,245
ah yes from the wild pines we'll meet her soon enough I'm sure

1476
01:17:21,795 --> 01:17:24,966
they want to keep that money flowing in my man ka-ching

1477
01:17:26,066 --> 01:17:26,770
it's all about money 

1478
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:30,666
I mean at the end of the day you gotta ask yourself

1479
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:34,472
who benefits who's collecting on this tragedy 

1480
01:17:34,472 --> 01:17:35,305
anything else

1481
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:39,483
us lorry drivers camionneurs

1482
01:17:39,933 --> 01:17:42,500
a few still hang around here waiting for this mess to end

1483
01:17:43,066 --> 01:17:46,210
most have scurried off somewhere to get drunk or high 

1484
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,466
or laid 

1485
01:17:47,857 --> 01:17:49,291
not that I blame 'em really

1486
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:50,824
not my thing 

1487
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:54,166
chasing transient pleasures is a drag these days

1488
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,366
I prefer the examined life now

1489
01:17:56,566 --> 01:17:58,966
thinkin' reflectin' observin'

1490
01:18:01,407 --> 01:18:06,900
he's just living his life experiencing everything around him

1491
01:18:07,007 --> 01:18:09,550
what's better than chasing transient pleasures 

1492
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:12,266
the more transient the better 

1493
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:15,533
when one's ended you can get onto the next one

1494
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:21,334
oh high grade narcotics illegal firearms stuff like that

1495
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:23,300
time to arrest him

1496
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,300
oh I can just arrest him like that

1497
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,800
nah Tommy wouldn't do that 

1498
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,000
Tommy wouldn't corrupt the world like that

1499
01:18:38,366 --> 01:18:40,933
ha no I'm joking my man 

1500
01:18:41,144 --> 01:18:42,944
FALN runs a nice clean business

1501
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,340
this haul of cargo is mostly sporting goods

1502
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:47,848
you know tracksuits and that kind of thing  

1503
01:18:48,528 --> 01:18:50,180
usually gets shipped to Graad and the Occident

1504
01:18:50,696 --> 01:18:52,574
不准调戏我的争强好胜！
though we've been making headway in the iilmaraan market lately

1505
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:54,628
我差点把他逮起来
though we've been making headway in the iilmaraan market lately

1506
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,683
I was gonna lock Tommy up for life

1507
01:19:06,766 --> 01:19:08,466
can I get one of those track suits

1508
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:09,666
we're pals and all

1509
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,533
but I can't just freely hand out the merchandise 

1510
01:19:12,533 --> 01:19:13,983
the bosses won't be happy 

1511
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:15,744
（选项：所以 没有什么违禁物品咯？）
not unless they've legalized sports equipment 

1512
01:19:15,744 --> 01:19:16,989
while I was on the road this rocking beauty

1513
01:19:16,989 --> 01:19:18,163
（选项：背后那个是你的車吗？）
this rockin' beauty sure is

1514
01:19:18,163 --> 01:19:19,784
this rockin' beauty sure is

1515
01:19:19,784 --> 01:19:21,272
 like a rash you can't get rid of 

1516
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:24,400
you interested in heavy duty cargo machinery

1517
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,466
yeah it must be 

1518
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:33,464
your job is to know all these little things isn't it

1519
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:37,164
well my job is to deliver tracksuit trousers 

1520
01:19:37,284 --> 01:19:39,437
汤米是个纯朴的人
there it is again a little touch of sadness beneath his cool 

1521
01:19:39,437 --> 01:19:41,933
there it is again a little touch of sadness beneath his cool 

1522
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:45,200
he thinks he's spent too long in this lorry

1523
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:49,420
I mean his name is literally Tommy the man

1524
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,533
yeah Tommy the man

1525
01:19:52,533 --> 01:19:54,133
loom loom

1526
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,533
the man taps his fingers rhythmically against his arm

1527
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:01,100
he's just a dude

1528
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:01,666
（检定-通情达理：你从他的眼睛里看到了什么?）
oh fuck yeah

1529
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:02,653
（检定-通情达理：你从他的眼睛里看到了什么?）
an empathy response 

1530
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,900
let's get a little bit deeper in with Tommy

1531
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,703
let's see what he's really made of 

1532
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,100
in his eyes a half-familiar longing

1533
01:20:11,853 --> 01:20:13,900
flecks of brown and gold

1534
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:15,600
（选项：怎么个熟悉法?）
it's hard to say 

1535
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,533
his gaze wonders southwest down the street 

1536
01:20:19,533 --> 01:20:22,100
that goes beyond the horizon

1537
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:23,966
what are you looking at Tommy

1538
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,366
what missed life are you thinking of 

1539
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:28,600
that you never got to live

1540
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:31,133
do you really want to sell tracksuits

1541
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:33,200
do you really think standing out here

1542
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,869
in the cold miserable environment 

1543
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:39,571
with all these trash cans and racists around 

1544
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:41,100
is where he wanted to be no

1545
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:44,933
Tommy had bigger dreams a bigger life imagined for himself 

1546
01:20:45,331 --> 01:20:47,066
hopefully one day we can get him there

1547
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:49,200
the road continues for miles 

1548
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,237
flowing together with other roads

1549
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:53,899
 turning into causeways or bridges 

1550
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:55,979
and in suddenly in dead ends 

1551
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:58,600
or ramping up or down highways 

1552
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,966
it forms a crisscross pattern across the land

1553
01:21:02,016 --> 01:21:02,966
where it lead

1554
01:21:02,966 --> 01:21:06,349
above the Jamrock Quarter in the form of a raised motorway 

1555
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:09,649
and then the never ending sprawl of Faubourg

1556
01:21:09,649 --> 01:21:12,065
high above buildings new and old 

1557
01:21:12,065 --> 01:21:15,815
the air filled with the rumble of motor engines

1558
01:21:15,815 --> 01:21:16,763
go further

1559
01:21:16,763 --> 01:21:17,350
to the old old south

1560
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:18,300
我好爱天人感应
to the old old south

1561
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:18,907
我好爱天人感应
to the farthest outskirts of Revachol

1562
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:19,151
to the farthest outskirts of Revachol

1563
01:21:19,151 --> 01:21:21,100
感谢刚才的加点建议
to the farthest outskirts of Revachol

1564
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,533
through the chequered fields of farmland

1565
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,947
upstream to the River Esperance 

1566
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:29,800
past Monte-Martin the border approaches 

1567
01:21:30,191 --> 01:21:31,996
（选项：边界上方是什么?）
you cannot see it's out of the city up ahead the mist blocks all sight

1568
01:21:31,996 --> 01:21:36,500
you cannot see it's out of the city up ahead the mist blocks all sight

1569
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:40,729
a gale blows across your cheeks it is cold 

1570
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:45,500
before you stands a tall lorry driver with sad eyes

1571
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,366
（选项：西南方有什么?）
excuse me

1572
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:49,569
I'm I fucking

I can fix you

1576
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,500
man

1577
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,709
I don't know what to say

1578
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:01,600
not much anyone can do

1579
01:22:02,466 --> 01:22:04,254
there's no helping an absence you know

1580
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:05,866
I miss my family

1581
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,500
they're all I have 

1582
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,000
my wife a second kid on the way

1583
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,472
waiting all the way in Deora 

1584
01:22:12,472 --> 01:22:14,533
and here I am stuck in this shit

1585
01:22:14,566 --> 01:22:16,191
so far from home

1586
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:19,300
oh this is my character's 

1587
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,886
latent failed therapist opportunity coming out 

1588
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:26,510
what's it like to miss someone Tommy

1589
01:22:28,266 --> 01:22:31,833
not just what it's like to miss someone as a human 

1590
01:22:32,321 --> 01:22:35,000
but what is it like for Tommy to miss someone

1591
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,800
what's it like good and bad

1592
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,716
an ache that brings you joy

1593
01:22:41,716 --> 01:22:43,366
I think of them a lot 

1594
01:22:43,366 --> 01:22:46,415
I dream up these silly scenarios in great detail 

1595
01:22:46,415 --> 01:22:48,216
of living with them 

1596
01:22:48,216 --> 01:22:49,483
it comforts me 

1597
01:22:49,483 --> 01:22:51,964
an ache that brings you joy

1598
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,466
let's drop all this crime investigation shit 

1599
01:22:56,466 --> 01:22:58,333
and just follow Tommy around

1600
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,400
what about you copman

1601
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,100
you missing someone 

1602
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,466
is that what it is this feeling

1603
01:23:05,866 --> 01:23:08,766
no it's scary than that

1604
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,726
you're pursued by a hunter 

1605
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,433
smelling of apricots and sorrow and the past

1606
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,733
I love this I love that there's two parts of me that are like

1607
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:24,066
 not in agreement with what it is I'm feeling

1608
01:23:25,466 --> 01:23:27,033
I miss my gun that's true 

1609
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:29,133
I'm a fine man I don't miss anyone 

1610
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:30,928
I miss someone but I don't know who it is 

1611
01:23:30,928 --> 01:23:31,789
that feels honest

1612
01:23:32,494 --> 01:23:35,430
no I feel hunted that does also feel quite honest 

1613
01:23:36,174 --> 01:23:37,270
I'm gonna get real with Tommy 

1614
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:41,470
I feel for you my friend it's bad enough to know who you miss 

1615
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:45,335
missing like that doesn't feel like it has much of an upside

1616
01:23:47,057 --> 01:23:48,975
but thanks for this

1617
01:23:49,432 --> 01:23:51,132
it's nice to talk to someone

1618
01:23:51,372 --> 01:23:53,129
and I know it wasn't easy to ask

1619
01:23:54,026 --> 01:23:56,776
I hope you find your way through your own troubles

1620
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:02,936
there's a therapy session on the cold streets for you 

1621
01:24:03,466 --> 01:24:05,653
we just made tommy's day a little bit brighter 

1622
01:24:05,653 --> 01:24:09,999
helped him clarify that that joyful aching is

1623
01:24:10,703 --> 01:24:14,319
actually something that gives meaning and value to 

1624
01:24:14,752 --> 01:24:17,266
the mission that he's on and the people that he misses

1625
01:24:19,466 --> 01:24:21,600
fuck man that was deep

1626
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:24,066
don't be a stranger

1627
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,666
still fucked up he didn't give me a cigarette though

1628
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,500
okay I'm pretty sure we're supposed to go north 

1629
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,833
getting fucking sidetracked by 

1630
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:41,200
all this interesting stuff that's happening around me

1631
01:24:50,466 --> 01:24:51,366
hello sir

1632
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:53,666
step right in the door is open

1633
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:01,073
I am the law I just go around and saying that to people 

1634
01:25:01,073 --> 01:25:03,848
are you interested in a new and exciting book 

1635
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:07,310
no does this kid have any cigarettes on her

1636
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,266
okay sir

1637
01:25:09,266 --> 01:25:11,600
I'll try to answer any questions you have

1638
01:25:11,733 --> 01:25:13,100
I hope they're about books 

1639
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:13,933
what's your name

1640
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:14,948
her name is Annette sir

1641
01:25:14,948 --> 01:25:18,400
my mum her name is Plaisance she owns the store

1642
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,133
she's inside minding the register or organizing the stock

1643
01:25:23,533 --> 01:25:26,166
this girl is extremely suspicious to me

1644
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:30,366
 I mean she's well dressed she's standing here unsupervised 

1645
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:34,912
and she's got a really positive like disposition about her 

1646
01:25:34,912 --> 01:25:37,533
like none of that stuff fits with the rest of her environment 

1647
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:39,400
free to step in and Brasall was 

1648
01:25:39,872 --> 01:25:42,400
I'm gonna guess that she was involved in the crime 

1649
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,266
this is the one who had the fucking light feet in the crime scene

1650
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,933
just standing here looking all inconspicuous 

1651
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:50,966
it's gotta be her I gotta arrest her

1652
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,666
I'm signalling that the story's open 

1653
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:55,399
otherwise people might not know 

1654
01:25:55,399 --> 01:25:59,099
they'd miss out on the crime romance ambography's a famous people

1655
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:03,728
a sudden gush of wind turns the pages of the books on the counters

1656
01:26:03,728 --> 01:26:06,448
 she covers her face smiling

1657
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,600
but she's cold

1658
01:26:09,366 --> 01:26:11,300
such a good trooper you are no

1659
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,466
I could brutally dismantle in the free market

1660
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:19,066
you're cold can I help in some way

1661
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,766
kind of you to officer

1662
01:26:21,866 --> 01:26:23,900
what could you do to help her anyway

1663
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:28,966
I could throw her in shackles

1664
01:26:31,133 --> 01:26:32,058
thank you sir

1665
01:26:32,058 --> 01:26:33,800
I'm happy to help mom out with the store

1666
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:34,533
here we go

1667
01:26:34,533 --> 01:26:37,300
this is the question for me where is your school

1668
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,066
why aren't you in school

1669
01:26:38,066 --> 01:26:39,628
I'm doing my studies at home at the moment 

1670
01:26:39,645 --> 01:26:41,663
I have to help mom keep this place running

1671
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,560
what is school anyway

1672
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,009
let's get Annette's opinion on that 

1673
01:26:46,009 --> 01:26:50,266
school well mine is a big yellow building on Boogie street  

1674
01:26:50,266 --> 01:26:51,529
and the people there run it 

1675
01:26:51,529 --> 01:26:53,330
they say it's a charity 

1676
01:26:53,956 --> 01:26:56,489
the gale wind blows in from the coast

1677
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,266
a wind of needles 

1678
01:26:58,266 --> 01:27:01,865
it wraps itself around a building of brick and mortar 

1679
01:27:02,256 --> 01:27:07,166
somewhere a clamour rings through the honeycomb of classrooms 

1680
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:10,930
I like this writing stings me 

1681
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:13,414
it stings me with how good it is 

1682
01:27:13,414 --> 01:27:15,410
a honeycomb of classrooms

1683
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:16,925
（选项：这是什么感觉?）
remorse

1684
01:27:16,925 --> 01:27:17,055
（选项：这是什么感觉?）

1685
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:19,266
the parquet of assembly halls

1686
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,300
the rows of stall bars are growing cold

1687
01:27:23,005 --> 01:27:24,689
 the corridors stand empty 

1688
01:27:25,597 --> 01:27:30,530
a girl's voice somehow finds its way through this strange feeling 

1689
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:34,633
you haven't heard a word of what she's been saying these past few moments 

1690
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:36,362
you only hear

1691
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:39,900
mom says it's necessary to do both because it builds character 

1692
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:41,933
mom says a proper worker is dutiful 

1693
01:27:41,933 --> 01:27:44,633
that's how you get ahead in life you succeed 

1694
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,169
mom says it's peachy 

1695
01:27:47,169 --> 01:27:48,866
she was a little afraid at first

1696
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,600
there's talk about this house being curved 

1697
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,100
behind her the window has been boarded up

1698
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:56,337
you sense the boards creaking

1699
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,070
twisting for a second 

1700
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:01,896
and some kind of doubt in her tense shoulders

1701
01:28:03,066 --> 01:28:04,733
cursed in the way that makes them say 

1702
01:28:04,733 --> 01:28:07,104
that no business has ever really thrived here sir

1703
01:28:07,104 --> 01:28:08,815
that they all go

1704
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:12,246
bankrupt

1705
01:28:12,725 --> 01:28:15,700
exactly but we've been doing fine so far

1706
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:17,900
I don't think curses are real

1707
01:28:19,533 --> 01:28:21,233
should probably look into this 

1708
01:28:21,233 --> 01:28:24,066
we can go into the bookstore and ask about the case

1709
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,936
but I don't seem much more to look into here

1710
01:28:26,936 --> 01:28:29,900
yeah well you've been fucking quiet this whole time kim

1711
01:28:30,146 --> 01:28:32,400
yes please do also look at our wares inside 

1712
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,900
the postcards and board games are there sir

1713
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,600
maybe I should show you about some of our books instead

1714
01:28:40,766 --> 01:28:43,366
okay you're distracting me child

1715
01:28:43,366 --> 01:28:47,450
unless you have a cancer stick for me to suckle on 

1716
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:49,565
I need I have things to do 

1717
01:28:49,565 --> 01:28:51,561
there's so many things to interact with though 

1718
01:28:51,561 --> 01:28:52,694
it's overwhelming

1719
01:28:52,966 --> 01:28:55,600
let's take a look at what do you find here

1720
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,451
this coin operated viewer is facing south

1721
01:28:58,451 --> 01:29:02,640
 the instruction manual says to insert 25 centims

1722
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,566
and pull the handle while looking inside 

1723
01:29:05,566 --> 01:29:09,766
then use the focus knob to zoom in if necessary

1724
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:11,566
well I don't have very much money

1725
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,240
I feel like my guys crafty enough to get a cigarette without paying for it 

1726
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,493
so I'm gonna drop some coinage and 

1727
01:29:20,493 --> 01:29:23,100
your money disappears into the coin slot

1728
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,300
a clunk the ring of metal

1729
01:29:26,266 --> 01:29:28,666
the curtains on the display open 

1730
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,866
you lean in to catch the view 

1731
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:33,700
it's blurry different blues and greens 

1732
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:38,566
in the middle of the shimmer stands a drab grey shape like a ghost

1733
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:44,300
the lenses shift the ghost sharpens into a islet in the bay 

1734
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,833
in the ruins a man made structure is visible 

1735
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:49,633
a half sunken sea fort 

1736
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:52,966
its concrete almost reconquered by nature 

1737
01:29:52,966 --> 01:29:57,100
it looks as if it was abandoned quite some time ago 

1738
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:01,266
nothing but a rotten tooth remains of the anti aircraft tower 

1739
01:30:01,266 --> 01:30:03,700
a lonely birch tree grows out of it 

1740
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,700
its leaves ripped from it by the winter wind

1741
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:14,466
damn 25 cents for all that fucking good world building

1742
01:30:17,533 --> 01:30:20,900
really I don't have the eyesight to make it out

1743
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:23,966
yeah we know that Kim you couldn't even shoot down the fucking corpse 

1744
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:28,800
the little brave birch tree seems to wave back in the wind

1745
01:30:36,466 --> 01:30:38,533
Tibbs has windows what do we got here

1746
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:40,500
some signage

1747
01:30:43,733 --> 01:30:45,866
yeah we need to get to the pier

1748
01:30:45,866 --> 01:30:47,900
 Kim getting bullied look Kim

1749
01:30:50,366 --> 01:30:52,100
me and Kim got work to do 

1750
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,604
I'm not sure exactly what his role is in this little duopoly we have

1751
01:30:56,604 --> 01:30:58,970
because he ain't actually doing much

1752
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,166

1770
01:32:17,205 --> 01:32:18,533

1771
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,533

1772
01:32:19,533 --> 01:32:20,800

1773
01:32:21,866 --> 01:32:25,566
given everybody who passes by fucking grief and existential dread

1774
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,766
I'm the law

1775
01:32:33,533 --> 01:32:35,143

1776
01:32:35,143 --> 01:32:38,902

1777
01:32:39,344 --> 01:32:40,466

1778
01:32:40,466 --> 01:32:42,692

go forth and forage in someone else's shit 

1782
01:32:52,173 --> 01:32:55,100
no shortage of squealers in these parts

1783
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,900
it's like all these fucking people

1784
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:03,366
and their vulgar tone towards adults and really people of authority okay

1785
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,600
whatever's happening in that school 

1786
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,733
they're not teaching them about how to respect cops

1787
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,266
actually there is a shortage of people 

1788
01:33:14,266 --> 01:33:18,333
who talk to us in a normal calm informative manner 

1789
01:33:18,766 --> 01:33:22,866

1791
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:27,666

1792
01:33:31,966 --> 01:33:33,533

1793
01:33:35,266 --> 01:33:37,466

01:33:37,466 --> 01:33:37,866
（选项：你一直往旁边看 你在看什么）

1795
01:33:37,866 --> 01:33:39,116
（选项：你一直往旁边看 你在看什么）
lieutenant is desperately searching for a handkerchief

1796
01:33:39,116 --> 01:33:41,166
lieutenant is desperately searching for a handkerchief

1797
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:46,902
she turns her head and face the coast 

1798
01:33:46,902 --> 01:33:48,883
hatred disgust

1799
01:33:48,883 --> 01:33:53,743
it's difficult to tell which of the two is more present in her girlish features 

1800
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:58,258
the woman on the boat does not notice her staring 

1801
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:02,550

1804
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,910
she is a professional negotiator of though 

1805
01:34:07,144 --> 01:34:10,981
I have the feeling she will be very cooperative while telling us nothing 

1806
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:14,533
you should take the lead ask her unexpected questions 

1807
01:34:14,533 --> 01:34:16,033
you know do your thing 

1808
01:34:16,033 --> 01:34:18,028
don't be afraid to get a bit wacky

1809
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,666
throwing her off is our best bet

1810
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,666
okay Kim yeah

1811
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:23,533

1812
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:25,266
that you've been fucking using 

1813
01:34:25,266 --> 01:34:25,662
isn't actually the best one for this 

1814
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:27,179
（辛迪：好主意 猪猡）
isn't actually the best one for this 

1815
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:27,541

1816

1821
01:34:33,644 --> 01:34:36,200
I'd like to watch her swim back to Ozonne

1822
01:34:37,133 --> 01:34:40,566
I'm already feeling soft and bruised 

1823
01:34:40,566 --> 01:34:44,333
by my my failed encounter with Cuno okay

1824
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:49,533
I've already had my ego and my actual body bruised 

1825
01:34:49,533 --> 01:34:52,133
every time I get insulted by another one of these kids 

1826
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:53,800
I just want to fucking lock them up

1827
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,533
just lock them up

1828

1830
01:34:56,959 --> 01:35:03,833
 I'm painting a beautiful mural an aero-graffitio visible from low orbit 

1831
01:35:03,833 --> 01:35:06,493
I haven't really started it yet

1832
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:08,922
I'm waiting for the right words

1833
01:35:09,342 --> 01:35:12,600
yeah okay you can't do shit so you don't know what to write

1834
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:16,300
why are you so committed to do defacing the building

1835
01:35:17,366 --> 01:35:19,133
I have an opinion on this want to hear it

1836
01:35:19,133 --> 01:35:19,933

1837
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,533

1838
01:35:23,533 --> 01:35:24,500
fucking lock her up

1839
01:35:24,566 --> 01:35:28,066

1840
01:35:28,133 --> 01:35:29,366

1841
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:31,600

1842
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,117

1845
01:35:35,243 --> 01:35:35,800
辛迪：没有人能够阻挡我

1846
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,700

1847
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,266

1848
01:35:40,866 --> 01:35:43,498
you know what

1849
01:35:45,133 --> 01:35:47,566
just because you're right doesn't make me happy about it

1850
01:35:47,566 --> 01:35:51,869
I don't condone the idea of using physical force on her 

1851
01:35:52,104 --> 01:35:54,100
she's a girl

1852
01:35:54,466 --> 01:35:57,700
yeah girl first child second let's lock her up

1856
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,459

1857
01:36:09,166 --> 01:36:11,533

1858
01:36:20,966 --> 01:36:21,766

1859
01:36:21,866 --> 01:36:24,050
let's go investigate this fucking

1860
01:36:25,733 --> 01:36:26,833
 this game is making 

1861
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:29,805
it's bringing out these fucking things in me these

1862
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,311
these traits 

1863
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:37,635
my authority and my ego 

1864
01:36:37,635 --> 01:36:43,733
it's weakening my ego making me vulgar

1865
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:50,966
that's I need some more magnesium always

1866
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,533
all right let's talk to this lady

1867
01:36:55,533 --> 01:36:59,676
the striking woman leans against the cabin top of her sailing boat 

1868
01:36:59,676 --> 01:37:01,443
smiling as you approach 

1869
01:37:01,676 --> 01:37:04,743
her green raincoat glistens with droplets 

1870
01:37:04,743 --> 01:37:07,819
a silk scarf is tied around her throat

1871
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,766
crime scene super cop Brady child listen here you little shit

1872
01:37:13,766 --> 01:37:17,133
yeah exactly with a child I'm like I lose all composure 

1873
01:37:17,133 --> 01:37:18,566
good afternoon offices

1874
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,866
I'm Joyce

1875
01:37:21,758 --> 01:37:23,008
不跟她握手...
Joyce L Messier 

1876
01:37:23,008 --> 01:37:23,479
Joyce L Messier 

1877
01:37:23,479 --> 01:37:27,079
I represent the board of wild pines the owners of the harbor 

1878
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:27,651
you gentlemen must be finally an adult

1879
01:37:27,651 --> 01:37:29,012
终于来了个成年人
you gentlemen must be finally an adult

1880
01:37:29,012 --> 01:37:29,400
you gentlemen must be finally an adult

1881
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:32,718
you know what

1882
01:37:32,718 --> 01:37:36,300
 because everyone else has come at me so fucking sideways 

1883
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,800
I don't trust her earnestness alright

1884
01:37:39,666 --> 01:37:42,500
there's only one person's hand I'm shaking in this whole playthrough 

1885
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,266
and it's kims

1886
01:37:47,566 --> 01:37:48,333
don't shake her hand

1887
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:49,566
I'm glad to see you here

1888
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,533
not shaking anyone's hand

1889
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:53,962
she is unfazed by your rudeness 

1890
01:37:53,962 --> 01:37:56,533
probably chocking it up to local custom

1891
01:37:56,766 --> 01:37:58,366
yeah tell you the certain dominance

1892
01:37:58,366 --> 01:38:01,400
I was dispatched to handle a strike not a lynching 

1893
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,633
anything I can do to assist the RCM in this matter I will 

1894
01:38:05,016 --> 01:38:06,466
what about Tommy

1895
01:38:06,466 --> 01:38:09,066
I think I don't know would I shake Tommy's hand 

1896
01:38:09,832 --> 01:38:13,159
I'm still a little bruised up by the fact that he didn't give me a sig

1897
01:38:16,966 --> 01:38:20,000
 I might give him like a solemn one of those

1898
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,829
like that but I don't know if I would do 

1899
01:38:22,829 --> 01:38:25,452
I want to know if I would go all the way to a handshake with Tommy 

1900
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:29,133
we need to get a little closer a little more acquainted first

1901
01:38:29,133 --> 01:38:30,966
that is good to hear madam 

1902
01:38:30,966 --> 01:38:33,830
my colleague will take the lead on this interview 

1903
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,875
I should let you know that he is recovering from an 

1904
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:38,955
unusual medical episode

1905
01:38:39,241 --> 01:38:40,972
very unusual

1906
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,566
but I can assure you of his ultimate competency

1907
01:38:45,866 --> 01:38:48,300
kids were rude to you now you're rude to her a cycle 

1908
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,195
a circle of rudeness exactly 

1909
01:38:50,733 --> 01:38:54,366
I'm just giving out the same thing that I'm getting here

1910
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
that's all what's happening

1911
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:01,733
how interesting

1912
01:39:02,766 --> 01:39:04,533
I wish you a swift recovery 

1913
01:39:04,787 --> 01:39:07,433
in the meanwhile you have my full cooperation 

1914
01:39:07,433 --> 01:39:10,566
and the full cooperation of the wild pines group

1915
01:39:11,058 --> 01:39:14,154
it's hard to get a read on her precise disposition

1916
01:39:14,467 --> 01:39:16,467
but she appears helpful

1917
01:39:16,827 --> 01:39:19,727
she appears suspicious what does she know about the crime

1918
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,152
I don't want to go so direct with the question yet

1919
01:39:27,152 --> 01:39:28,933
first I want to see where she's coming at 

1920
01:39:28,933 --> 01:39:31,916
how much is she willing to divulge before I start pushing on her 

1921
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:32,620
（选项：说说野松公司 你们是做什么的）
what we do

1922
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:33,095
（选项：说说野松公司 你们是做什么的）

1923
01:39:33,466 --> 01:39:36,900
I'm afraid I don't speak for wild pines as a whole 

1924
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,800
it is a giant undertaking

1925
01:39:38,866 --> 01:39:40,366
isn't that exactly what you do

1926
01:39:40,366 --> 01:39:41,300
you're the rep

1927
01:39:42,066 --> 01:39:43,566
（选项：所以 *他们*是做什么的）
the pines core competency is logistics 

1928
01:39:43,566 --> 01:39:45,317
the pines core competency is logistics 

1929
01:39:45,939 --> 01:39:48,677
container shipping freight that sort of thing 

1930
01:39:48,677 --> 01:39:51,210
see those air ships there blinking 

1931
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,566
those are the shipping side of things 

1932
01:39:53,969 --> 01:39:57,571
and that is the terminal another subdivision deals with energy

1933
01:39:57,923 --> 01:40:01,290
oil and gas exploration offshore platforms

1934
01:40:02,733 --> 01:40:04,000
how much money you guys handled

1935
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,614
I'm not at liberty to discuss the company balance sheet 

1936
01:40:06,614 --> 01:40:08,219
but I can tell you that 

1937
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:13,400
last year the company booked more than 20 billion Real in revenue

1938
01:40:13,566 --> 01:40:17,569
you're right Tommy not giving me a sig was the failure on my part that's true

1939
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:22,352
 I've sort of neglected that point of it

1940
01:40:22,352 --> 01:40:26,566
because my perception was so bad that 

1941
01:40:26,566 --> 01:40:29,243
despite him literally holding a cigarette 

1942
01:40:29,908 --> 01:40:33,428
he was able to convince me that he doesn't smoke

1943
01:40:34,606 --> 01:40:36,319
a billion

1944
01:40:44,766 --> 01:40:48,066
it's a number officer a big one

1945
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:52,400
it's a lot of smoke money why I failed punching Cuno

1946
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,651
no that was not my fault 

1947
01:40:54,651 --> 01:40:57,066
it's made of one thousand millions

1948
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,936
a million is made of a thousand thousands

1949
01:40:59,936 --> 01:41:02,000
twenty billion is a large number

1950
01:41:02,208 --> 01:41:05,182
but the conglomerate employs 72000 people 

1951
01:41:05,417 --> 01:41:06,633
they all need to be paid 

1952
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:10,700
then there are capital improvements interest payments

1953
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:16,100
a conglomerate the size of the wild pines is like a shark 

1954
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,400
if it stops moving it will die 

1955
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:24,275
then what becomes of those 72000 families it's a tremendous responsibility

1956
01:41:24,733 --> 01:41:26,533
so where do you get all those buildings 

1957
01:41:26,533 --> 01:41:28,866
they started as an exploration and cargo fleet 

1958
01:41:28,866 --> 01:41:33,369
conducting trade between the Samaran and Insulindian isolas 

1959
01:41:33,369 --> 01:41:35,288
250 years ago 

1960
01:41:35,288 --> 01:41:40,166
when Pine's ships explored the south Semenese and charted Lo Manthang

1961
01:41:40,166 --> 01:41:41,671
on behalf of the suzarain

1962
01:41:41,904 --> 01:41:44,000
centuriea of care deliberation and madness have gone into this endeavour

1963
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,533
足够了女士
centuriea of care deliberation and madness have gone into this endeavour

1964
01:41:44,533 --> 01:41:46,800
坦白说吧 我对你讲的这些都不感兴趣
centuriea of care deliberation and madness have gone into this endeavour

1965
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,720
centuriea of care deliberation and madness have gone into this endeavour

1966
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:52,161
vessels pass through the Great Unrest to re-emerge with apricots in tow 

1967
01:41:52,161 --> 01:41:54,980
the logic of the system is totalizing 

1968
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:58,700
it's taken everything from its employees to build it

1969
01:42:00,716 --> 01:42:02,649
so what the fuck are you doing here

1970
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:05,200
you mean aside from being the terminal's legal owners 

1971
01:42:05,472 --> 01:42:09,400
who are responsible for moving eight percent of the world's cargo

1972
01:42:11,066 --> 01:42:13,100
eight percent of all cargo in the world

1973
01:42:14,933 --> 01:42:16,966
you don't keep it moving the workers do

1974
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,366
yeah let's now that she's getting a little annoyed 

1975
01:42:21,366 --> 01:42:24,146
that I asked her to explain to me what is a billion 

1976
01:42:24,459 --> 01:42:26,133
and then what do you do with that money

1977
01:42:26,133 --> 01:42:27,133
let's let's keep going

1978
01:42:27,133 --> 01:42:29,083
we built this district

1979
01:42:29,627 --> 01:42:31,483
 all the best parts of it

1980
01:42:31,741 --> 01:42:34,600
Rue de Saint-Ghislaine with its bastions

1981
01:42:34,766 --> 01:42:37,382
the plaza's Meteoran mosaic 

1982
01:42:37,382 --> 01:42:40,197
even some of the old street lamps have been put back

1983
01:42:40,197 --> 01:42:42,483
thanks to the investments from the WP 

1984
01:42:44,133 --> 01:42:47,401
before Martinez was swallowed by the Industrial Harbor

1985
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:49,866
even before it was part of Revachol

1986
01:42:49,866 --> 01:42:52,166
long before Terminal B was erected here 

1987
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:56,333
the pines built it as a resort for its Revacholian employees

1988
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:59,933
a company getaway for a weekend or a summer holiday 

1989
01:43:00,281 --> 01:43:03,765
then came the revolution but that's another matter 

1990
01:43:04,509 --> 01:43:08,111
I'm here to make sure the pines can fulfill their responsibilities

1991
01:43:08,111 --> 01:43:09,833
 to the place they built 

1992
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:11,987
with your help hopefully 

1993
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,900
says her warm tone

1994
01:43:17,966 --> 01:43:20,100
let's just make a clear observation here

1995
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,233
why yes I am 

1996
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,933
not a lot of people on boats are there

1997
01:43:23,933 --> 01:43:24,766
of course there are

1998
01:43:25,493 --> 01:43:26,668
we're on an archipelago 

1999
01:43:26,668 --> 01:43:28,466
how else are you supposed to get around

2000
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,075
what do you mean archipelago 

2001
01:43:30,766 --> 01:43:34,300
I mean we are on Le Caillou are we not 

2002
01:43:38,466 --> 01:43:42,800
we are and the city of Revachol is on the island of Le Caillou

2003
01:43:43,166 --> 01:43:44,951
still I haven't seen anyone else sail about around here 

2004
01:43:44,951 --> 01:43:46,947
I haven't seen anyone else drive a souped-up 

2005
01:43:46,947 --> 01:43:49,400
Coupris Kineema motor carriage either

2006
01:43:49,533 --> 01:43:52,666
actually that motor carriage has been specially issued 

2007
01:43:52,666 --> 01:43:55,133
to serve as a patrol and pursued vehicle 

2008
01:43:55,133 --> 01:43:59,625
it's for crossing long distances in the greater Revachol Industrial Harbor

2009
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:00,933
金 金 金
it's not a toy

2010
01:44:00,933 --> 01:44:01,500
what are you doing

2011
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,933
I thought you said I got this 

2012
01:44:02,933 --> 01:44:04,029
neither is this

2013
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:04,733
a toy I mean 

2014
01:44:04,766 --> 01:44:08,600
it's a machine for crossing long distances in the bay of Revachol

2015
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,966
 between the city and the Islands

2016
01:44:13,166 --> 01:44:16,400
she's having a good time arguing against the law 

2017
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,400
too good perhaps

2018
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:17,782
太超过了
too good perhaps

2019
01:44:17,782 --> 01:44:18,266
太超过了

2020
01:44:18,266 --> 01:44:24,333
authority you're starting to like really speak to my core here

2021
01:44:25,866 --> 01:44:27,166
do you have a license for this boat 

2022
01:44:27,166 --> 01:44:28,466
officer I assure you 

2023
01:44:28,466 --> 01:44:31,866
I'm a highly qualified pleasure craft operator

2024
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:37,100
the crowns of her teeth are porcelain white as the boats howl as she smiles 

2025
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:41,400
qualified pleasure craft operator so charming

2026
01:44:41,466 --> 01:44:44,933
yeah where's their license give me the fucking proof

2027
01:44:44,933 --> 01:44:48,633
...safety inspection last month offices it is completely seaworthy 

2028
01:44:48,633 --> 01:44:53,500
in fact it's taken part in not one but two insulindic regarters

2029
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,366
 even finished once

2030
01:44:55,366 --> 01:44:57,200
that's not enough I need to see

2031
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:58,333
it really you don't

2032
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:02,000
Kim

2033
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:05,366
what are you doing

2034
01:45:05,366 --> 01:45:06,900
you said I got this you said be wacky 

2035
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,466
why is he getting in the way of this now

2036
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,400
who benefits okay

2037
01:45:12,666 --> 01:45:14,766
where does Kim get his money

2038
01:45:16,766 --> 01:45:18,733
does he get it from wild pines

2039
01:45:21,366 --> 01:45:22,000
I police

2040
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,500
this is a little known fact among those who police 

2041
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:27,433
that the Wayfarer Act specifically denies the RCM 

2042
01:45:27,433 --> 01:45:30,200
the authority to demand anyone's operator license

2043
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:33,066
Kim's only job at this point is to fucking 

2044
01:45:33,066 --> 01:45:34,882
embarrass me in front of people 

2045
01:45:35,156 --> 01:45:38,933
don't tell me that in private afterwards okay

2046
01:45:38,933 --> 01:45:43,143
don't ever ever discount my authority like that 

2047
01:45:43,143 --> 01:45:45,900
in front of someone who I am interrogating okay

2048
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:47,333
this is all part of the ploy

2049
01:45:52,866 --> 01:45:54,000
that's weak

2050
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,266
unless it's their passport no 

2051
01:45:58,266 --> 01:46:00,525
do you want to ask for the ladies

2052
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:04,266
you need to save face if you want her respect

2053
01:46:04,266 --> 01:46:06,100
DEMAND that passport 

2054
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,733
I demand it give me the passport

2055
01:46:11,566 --> 01:46:14,300
the woman is silent smiling

2056
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,766
while the waves lap against the hull

2057
01:46:16,766 --> 01:46:19,066
in your hand under the plastic

2058
01:46:19,066 --> 01:46:23,266
a light blue passport saying Republic of Vesper

2059
01:46:23,466 --> 01:46:27,460
the coat of arms has a lion and an ostrich sejant

2060
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:30,700
he can he's completely undermining me okay 

2061
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,537
first he says take the lead 

2062
01:46:33,133 --> 01:46:35,100
say whatever you want all you gotta do is get her talking 

2063
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,166
and then the second

2064
01:46:36,166 --> 01:46:38,366
I try to go down that path he's like actually

2065
01:46:38,966 --> 01:46:43,400
I'm gonna expose you for being ruthlessly stupid and unqualified to do this

2066
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:47,933
the woman born in the year 3 in the commune of Revachol

2067
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,533
smiles at you 

2068
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:53,475
face adorned with frown lines and crow's feet 

2069
01:46:53,475 --> 01:46:54,475
the photo is recent

2070
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,266
he's broken my trust 

2071
01:46:56,266 --> 01:46:58,701
Rejoyce Layton-Messier

2072
01:46:58,701 --> 01:47:02,900
but I don't know what the law is look that doesn't matter okay

2073
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:04,500
that doesn't matter cybercat

2074
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,366
so you're from Vesper

2075
01:47:07,366 --> 01:47:08,333
my husband is

2076
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:09,733
I have dual citizenship 

2077
01:47:09,733 --> 01:47:12,000
a Vespertine is handier when traveling

2078
01:47:12,286 --> 01:47:12,817
I fucking hate this woman

2079
01:47:12,817 --> 01:47:13,499
你的名字叫雷乔伊斯？
I fucking hate this woman

2080
01:47:13,499 --> 01:47:14,400
你的名字叫雷乔伊斯？
yes but please don't call me that 

2081
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,100
yes but please don't call me that 

2082
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,300
Joyce is much more efficient

2083
01:47:19,066 --> 01:47:22,219
and yes if i dig into my own character psychology 

2084
01:47:22,219 --> 01:47:24,733
the reason I hate her is because she makes me feel inadequate

2085
01:47:24,733 --> 01:47:26,200
she doesn't like it 

2086
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:30,733
probably a bad memory mean girls at school or some ancient lover 

2087
01:47:30,733 --> 01:47:33,100
yeah we're gonna press on that later

2088
01:47:33,133 --> 01:47:36,676
she nods and returns the plastic bag to her coat

2089
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,066
but it actually fits into my roleplay character 

2090
01:47:40,066 --> 01:47:41,275
because the whole idea was 

2091
01:47:41,275 --> 01:47:43,723
I'm not really someone who respects the law 

2092
01:47:43,723 --> 01:47:46,150
I'm a failed therapist to became a cop

2093
01:47:46,366 --> 01:47:52,649
so that I could wield authority to people and get information out of them 

2094
01:47:52,649 --> 01:47:56,368
and pretend to myself that I have a moral right to do it

2095
01:47:56,368 --> 01:47:58,874
so yes I don't need to know the law 

2096
01:47:58,874 --> 01:48:02,807
I think I have a better opinion that the law demands I validate 

2097
01:48:03,466 --> 01:48:06,266
it's just who I wish I could be yeah fucking

2098
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:12,533
smoked out drugged up and very unapproachable

2099
01:48:15,825 --> 01:48:17,626
the boat no

2100
01:48:17,626 --> 01:48:23,068
it is called Cor-de-Leite 19 because that's the type of sloop it is

2101
01:48:23,068 --> 01:48:24,066
oh it's a sloop

2102
01:48:24,066 --> 01:48:27,133
it's a word it feels strange

2103
01:48:27,933 --> 01:48:30,933
such a beautiful boat deserves a proper name

2104
01:48:30,933 --> 01:48:32,700
a breeze ripples through the sails

2105
01:48:32,725 --> 01:48:34,325
对 快用天人感应甩我
and tugs at your hair

2106
01:48:34,766 --> 01:48:39,800
below the sleek fish like shape of the hull parts the water 

2107
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:42,700
beneath that a resounding darkness

2108
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:47,300
you're reminded of something or someone

2109
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,700
cool but your boat really needs a name

2110
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:54,033
okay how about Cor-de-Leite 19 why

2111
01:48:54,033 --> 01:48:55,393
好无聊
okay how about Cor-de-Leite 19 why

2112
01:48:56,187 --> 01:48:58,566
 because it was manufactured in Revachol east 

2113
01:48:58,566 --> 01:49:01,004
by a company called Cor-de-Leite

2114
01:49:01,004 --> 01:49:03,666
and its hull is 19 paces long

2115
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:07,133
how about the sleek fish

2116
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:11,933
how about Dolores

2117
01:49:12,166 --> 01:49:13,600
why Dolores

2118
01:49:17,733 --> 01:49:19,600
well it means nothing to me 

2119
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,056
I think I'll stick with a factory name but thank you for the suggestion 

2120
01:49:23,056 --> 01:49:23,641
it's a pleasure craft a 19 pacer  

2121
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:24,955
（选项：这是什么*类型*的船呢？）
it's a pleasure craft a 19 pacer  

2122
01:49:24,955 --> 01:49:26,300
it's a pleasure craft a 19 pacer  

2123
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:29,966
it also happens to be rated for category 1 racing 

2124
01:49:30,405 --> 01:49:33,067
though these days I may use it for business 

2125
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:35,440
my sloop I like it a lot

2126
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,200
it's the eel's hips baby

2127
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,990
I'm enjoying this part of the interview 

2128
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:44,200
it has so little to do with the murder we're investigating 

2129
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:44,900
Kim

2130
01:49:45,701 --> 01:49:47,734
can I fire Kim

2131
01:49:48,691 --> 01:49:51,634
 this is a part of the investigation

2132
01:49:51,634 --> 01:49:53,468
okay I'm learning about 

2133
01:49:53,468 --> 01:49:56,468
the person I'm canvassing the scene Kim 

2134
01:49:56,468 --> 01:49:59,468
I'm scoping out fucking details that

2135
01:49:59,468 --> 01:50:04,734
 you and your logic adult brain could never perceive okay

2136
01:50:04,768 --> 01:50:08,401
my brain is on like inland empire and shiver shit all right 

2137
01:50:08,401 --> 01:50:13,104
it's pulling together like cosmic psychological archetypal information

2138
01:50:13,104 --> 01:50:14,934
 from like everywhere around me 

2139
01:50:14,934 --> 01:50:19,434
and you're just like why aren't you asking her if she knows about the crime

2140
01:50:19,468 --> 01:50:20,901
you fucking idiot 

2141
01:50:21,272 --> 01:50:24,839
I'll teach him I'll teach him how to investigate 

2142
01:50:24,839 --> 01:50:27,505
I really do the lieutenant thinks 

2143
01:50:27,505 --> 01:50:29,205
is she thrown off yet 

2144
01:50:29,542 --> 01:50:32,305
he's looking at the woman assessing her

2145
01:50:33,468 --> 01:50:34,268
good

2146
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:39,966
all right

2147
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:41,333
quite a few things follow

2148
01:50:41,333 --> 01:50:42,319
follow your lead Kim

2149
01:50:43,418 --> 01:50:46,966
 just try punching Kim I should go for it

2150
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:49,666
the information I'm to share with you 

2151
01:50:49,666 --> 01:50:51,640
includes sensitive trade secrets 

2152
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,362
for the sake of my employer 

2153
01:50:53,362 --> 01:50:55,600
I have to ask for your names and page numbers

2154
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,466
so are you fucking kidding me

2155
01:50:58,466 --> 01:51:01,740
I can't scope a peep at her license

2156
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:03,166
but I have to show her my badge

2157
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:05,577
I don't have my badge

2158
01:51:05,577 --> 01:51:08,933
of course ma'am we should have introduced ourselves

2159
01:51:08,933 --> 01:51:12,066
I am lieutenant kitsuragi from precinct 57

2160
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,733
and this is my colleague from precinct 41 

2161
01:51:15,733 --> 01:51:18,466
I'm afraid he doesn't have his badge at the moment 

2162
01:51:18,466 --> 01:51:19,900
I hope mine will suffice

2163
01:51:25,866 --> 01:51:29,300
Kim agrees with your method he's just playing good cop well look

2164
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:32,166
I wouldn't have really really poor perception 

2165
01:51:32,166 --> 01:51:35,266
if I didn't pick up on that

2166
01:51:37,666 --> 01:51:42,500
how does it benefit me to contradict me and embarrass me

2167
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,733
in front of fucking Cuno and this

2168
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,966
weird dame

2169
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,066
how curious

2170
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:51,766
why is that detective

2171
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:54,254
我不接受提问
awkwardness washes over the conversation

2172
01:51:54,254 --> 01:51:54,675
awkwardness washes over the conversation

2173
01:51:55,258 --> 01:51:57,733
the woman doesn't like this turn of events

2174
01:51:58,133 --> 01:52:01,717
I see so are you saying you

2175
01:52:01,717 --> 01:52:04,458
 lost your badge during the course of this episode

2176
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:06,333
I swear to god if she laughs at me

2177
01:52:06,333 --> 01:52:08,600
I am gonna ask for that gun back

2178
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:18,841
let's go with the absurdist idea

2179
01:52:18,841 --> 01:52:20,166
乔伊斯：哦 *天啦*
let's go with the absurdist idea

2180
01:52:22,666 --> 01:52:25,066
I suppose this does explain some of the 

2181
01:52:25,066 --> 01:52:27,400
more curious turns in our conversation

2182
01:52:27,566 --> 01:52:31,466
as I said ma'am his technique may be very inconventional

2183
01:52:31,666 --> 01:52:34,408
but he is an officer of RCM

2184
01:52:34,408 --> 01:52:36,520
of course I sympathize 

2185
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:39,379
but I'm afraid I simply can't share anything more 

2186
01:52:39,379 --> 01:52:40,362
until I see that badge

2187
01:52:40,362 --> 01:52:44,000
 see that technique that I just used right there is disarming her  

2188
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,215
see now she thinks I'm a bumbling idiot 

2189
01:52:46,215 --> 01:52:50,366
who can't string together a coherent line of questioning

2190
01:52:50,366 --> 01:52:55,704
and that I am so hungover that I lost my badge 

2191
01:52:57,016 --> 01:52:59,600
despite both of those things being true 

2192
01:52:59,972 --> 01:53:02,533
she maybe will more 

2193
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:07,488
more vulnerable to my other techniques 

2194
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:10,566
look those two things can be true 

2195
01:53:10,566 --> 01:53:13,533
and I can still use them to my advantage 

2196
01:53:13,533 --> 01:53:16,866
hang on she's a professional negotiator

2197
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:21,308
 she should be open to some sort of mutually beneficial arrangement 

2198
01:53:21,395 --> 01:53:23,133
（检定-循循善诱 ：我该如何通过谈判来解决这个问题？）

2199
01:53:23,133 --> 01:53:24,871
（检定-循循善诱 ：我该如何通过谈判来解决这个问题？）
72 percent let's go easy

2200
01:53:24,871 --> 01:53:26,280
72 percent let's go easy

2201
01:53:37,133 --> 01:53:38,600
what the fuck

2202
01:53:46,466 --> 01:53:47,666
what did I tell you

2203
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:48,733
what did I tell you

2204
01:53:49,066 --> 01:53:50,200
every single time

2205
01:53:51,966 --> 01:53:54,533
17 percent yeah I'll pass that every time 

2206
01:53:54,533 --> 01:53:57,666
anything higher than 50 you can guarantee I'm gonna fail it

2207
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:04,733
I assure you it is no small matter for me either 

2208
01:54:04,733 --> 01:54:08,399
we all share the responsibility for disarming this situation 

2209
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:11,466
I hope you have a badge for me as soon as possible

2210
01:54:11,466 --> 01:54:12,600
are you serious

2211
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,666
I actually need to go get my badge

2212
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:21,300
you have so much else 

2213
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:23,600
I only have this spread my hands 

2214
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,500
this is the entirety of my existence 

2215
01:54:27,353 --> 01:54:29,566
that's quite the agents of change scene

2216
01:54:33,733 --> 01:54:35,100
or stop immediately doing checks 

2217
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:36,800
look I get excited

2218
01:54:37,066 --> 01:54:39,800
I saw the 72 percenter and I was like that's easy

2219
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,800
（选项：我什么也没有 只剩下这个案子了）

2220
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,666
（选项：我什么也没有 只剩下这个案子了）
officer

2221
01:54:45,866 --> 01:54:46,700
come on

2222
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,566
I'm losing ground here

2223
01:54:55,466 --> 01:54:58,334
you know I don't mean to sound cold 

2224
01:54:58,334 --> 01:54:59,966
but if you want something

2225
01:54:59,966 --> 01:55:03,614
you have to give something back more than just guilt 

2226
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:05,400
you're doing it

2227
01:55:05,666 --> 01:55:08,679
despite your own best efforts you're still getting in

2228
01:55:09,266 --> 01:55:10,666
I'll be frank with you 

2229
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:12,453
if I'm going to break protocol

2230
01:55:12,453 --> 01:55:15,585
I need to be able to justify it to my superiors 

2231
01:55:15,585 --> 01:55:18,795
they're going to want to see something tangible 

2232
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:22,593
the union is conducting drug trade out of the Harbor 

2233
01:55:22,593 --> 01:55:25,153
it's an open secret in Martinaise 

2234
01:55:25,153 --> 01:55:29,086
surely it must not come as a complete surprise to the RCM either 

2235
01:55:29,405 --> 01:55:31,597
perhaps it's time to look into it 

2236
01:55:31,597 --> 01:55:34,462
or you can find your badge

2237
01:55:34,729 --> 01:55:36,914
 which honestly seems like a lost cause

2238
01:55:38,866 --> 01:55:41,933
detective a word in private before we continue

2239
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,366
okay what is it Kim 

2240
01:55:45,366 --> 01:55:46,400
what do you got for me

2241
01:55:50,566 --> 01:55:52,133
honestly I was expecting you 

2242
01:55:52,133 --> 01:55:55,233
to use your unorthodox technique to keep her off balance  

2243
01:55:55,233 --> 01:55:57,966
and you know not putting tears to be her henchman

2244
01:55:58,466 --> 01:56:00,076
I thought it was going well

2245
01:56:00,076 --> 01:56:02,466
someone is running circles around us

2246
01:56:02,466 --> 01:56:05,187
 she might have known about your misplaced badge all along 

2247
01:56:05,187 --> 01:56:07,916
or she's simply an adept improviser 

2248
01:56:07,933 --> 01:56:10,733
either way we've played straight into her hand 

2249
01:56:10,733 --> 01:56:12,366
he doesn't let it show

2250
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:15,366
but there is a limit to how much the consequences 

2251
01:56:15,366 --> 01:56:18,800
of your unprofessional behavior can cost the investigation 

2252
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,966
look all I know is that things worked out very well when I had the gun

2253
01:56:23,823 --> 01:56:25,300
 if you just give it back to me now 

2254
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:29,733
I think that we will be in much better circumstances

2255
01:56:33,133 --> 01:56:35,600
yeah I have to pay more attention to the red checks

2256
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:41,161
I'll throw it back on Kim what do you

2257
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:45,533
you think we shouldn't investigate drug trafficking

2258
01:56:47,266 --> 01:56:50,910
no if there is reasonable suspicion we must investigate 

2259
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:54,033
otherwise she could claim we are siding with the union 

2260
01:56:54,364 --> 01:56:56,541
or that we are on their take 

2261
01:56:56,606 --> 01:56:58,500
we'd never hear the end of it 

2262
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:59,566
she's really put us in a bind

2263
01:56:59,566 --> 01:57:03,100
what I propose is we ask her then we investigate briefly 

2264
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:06,966
but do not share the outcome of this investigation with her

2265
01:57:07,266 --> 01:57:10,766
we tell her it's done and demand for her information on the lynching

2266
01:57:12,975 --> 01:57:14,500
oh that would be fantastic

2267
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,933
but do we have the time

2268
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:19,133
the world is large and your badge is 8 by 6 centimeters

2269
01:57:20,966 --> 01:57:24,500
this logic that Kim is wielding against me

2270
01:57:26,166 --> 01:57:29,133
it's frustrating because he's right and I hate that 

2271
01:57:29,133 --> 01:57:31,366
you could request a new one from your station

2272
01:57:31,366 --> 01:57:33,580
but that would literally take months 

2273
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:36,514
it would not hurt if you tried more in the future

2274
01:57:38,766 --> 01:57:39,466
okay Kim

2275
01:57:39,466 --> 01:57:41,730
now you're actually just trying to hurt my feelings 

2276
01:57:42,366 --> 01:57:46,266
you're back good what can I help you with

2277
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,900
乔伊斯：事情其实挺简单的
that's fucking investigate the drugs

2278
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:52,166
someone is using Terminal B to smuggle raw ingredients 

2279
01:57:52,166 --> 01:57:55,589
from the Samaran isola into Revachol with the union's blessing 

2280
01:57:55,966 --> 01:57:58,566
wild pines has suspected it for years

2281
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:04,133
what's amazing is how well this game is responding in every single circumstance

2282
01:58:04,133 --> 01:58:09,966
 to my attempts to like subvert it and also to role play 

2283
01:58:09,966 --> 01:58:14,133
like I can't believe how well it's responding to everything 

2284
01:58:14,133 --> 01:58:17,466
and still keeping the narrative like consistent 

2285
01:58:17,466 --> 01:58:21,100
like I can see that there's multiple branching paths

2286
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:23,533
but the way this is being told to me feels like 

2287
01:58:23,533 --> 01:58:26,066
this is the only one like it feels unique enough

2288
01:58:26,066 --> 01:58:26,900
which is crazy 

2289
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,600
ingredients for what

2290
01:58:28,827 --> 01:58:31,066
meth and dextroamphetamin

2291
01:58:31,066 --> 01:58:33,564
GBL and various synthetic psychedelics 

2292
01:58:33,564 --> 01:58:37,200
honestly it might be quick to say what you can't make from the stuff

2293
01:58:40,475 --> 01:58:44,056
yes after they clear the terminal we lose track 

2294
01:58:44,376 --> 01:58:46,759
the actual production is taking place 

2295
01:58:46,759 --> 01:58:49,523
at various sites in and around Jamrock quarter

2296
01:58:49,523 --> 01:58:50,800
north of here

2297
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,634
wildpine seems to be well apprised of the local direct trade ma'am

2298
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:58,306
do you mean to see the union also produces the product 

2299
01:58:58,306 --> 01:58:59,573
says drugs I mean 

2300
01:58:59,573 --> 01:59:00,840
we're in logistics

2301
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:03,043
it's our business to know 

2302
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:08,600
and no as far as the company knows the union does not produce it 

2303
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,466
they transport the ingredients for a cut 

2304
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:13,800
yeah that's what's crazy is like 

2305
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:15,792
I can imagine going a different route and 

2306
01:59:15,792 --> 01:59:20,666
just a whole complete other turn of events taking place

2307
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:27,668
yes but you won't get anything out of Evrart in the dockworkers union 

2308
01:59:27,668 --> 01:59:31,666
still every chain has its weak link

2309
01:59:34,966 --> 01:59:36,325
mmm the bolt cutters

2310
01:59:36,325 --> 01:59:37,200
（乔伊斯：那些货車）
mmm the bolt cutters

2311
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:40,940
someone needs to move the ingredients from the harbor into the city 

2312
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:42,533
once they reach Jamrock

2313
01:59:42,533 --> 01:59:45,900
they're distributed to a network of local manufacturers 

2314
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:47,233
well beyond our grasp 

2315
01:59:47,474 --> 01:59:49,607
but in transit they are vulnerable 

2316
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:52,645
perhaps you've noticed that a number of lorries are tangled

2317
01:59:52,645 --> 01:59:55,190
 in a traffic jam at the roundabout just now 

2318
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:58,140
interview the drivers who are still hanging about 

2319
01:59:58,620 --> 02:00:01,653
one of them might be waiting for a crucial shipment

2320
02:00:01,653 --> 02:00:02,466
她在说汤米？可能是汤米

2321
02:00:02,466 --> 02:00:03,400
她在说汤米？可能是汤米
I'll be explicit

2322
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:05,266
if you find this driver

2323
02:00:05,566 --> 02:00:07,800
I will share company secrets with you

2324
02:00:08,133 --> 02:00:10,693
you'll be indebted to her in a way 

2325
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:14,732
but one step ahead of the union in another

2326
02:00:15,933 --> 02:00:17,533
it's a good point authority

2327
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:25,166
no we asked East Motor Tract to raise the drawbridge 

2328
02:00:25,166 --> 02:00:28,741
the road company is a partner of one of our subsidiaries 

2329
02:00:28,741 --> 02:00:32,341
however this is a limited time opportunity 

2330
02:00:32,341 --> 02:00:35,500
once the complaint has been processed by the trade committee

2331
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:37,863
they'll have no choice but to lower the drawbridge 

2332
02:00:37,863 --> 02:00:39,729
and the operation will continue

2333
02:00:40,266 --> 02:00:44,966
 thousands of litres of raw ingredients will pour onto the streets of Revachol

2334
02:00:45,166 --> 02:00:46,632
not the east across the river 

2335
02:00:46,632 --> 02:00:49,666
 but the west the vulnerable the weary

2336
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,566
cold breath rushes in from the bay

2337
02:00:53,933 --> 02:00:57,843
making its way down the alleyways and potholed streets 

2338
02:00:57,843 --> 02:00:59,833
from Martinaise to Jamrock 

2339
02:01:00,178 --> 02:01:03,666
in the traffic you hear the clinking of glass vials

2340
02:01:03,666 --> 02:01:06,000
 concealed beneath tarpaulin

2341
02:01:06,533 --> 02:01:08,866
or is it just your teeth chattering in the cold

2342
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:10,366
fucking misery

2343
02:01:10,366 --> 02:01:14,733
a lot of it it comes in from large Samaran factories

2344
02:01:14,733 --> 02:01:17,933
 in south Safre Siigay and Hsin-Yao

2345
02:01:18,066 --> 02:01:22,166
the literage they must get from this terminal alone must be oceanic

2346
02:01:22,232 --> 02:01:25,199
well at least this solves one mystery

2347
02:01:25,232 --> 02:01:26,766
what is that lieutenant

2348
02:01:26,766 --> 02:01:31,419
why I had to call east moto tract and beg them to open a drawbridge for me 

2349
02:01:31,791 --> 02:01:35,132
I had wonder since I first drove in on my motocarriage

2350
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:39,200
I am sorry for the inconvenience lieutenant Kitsuragi

2351
02:01:39,366 --> 02:01:41,233
but we need them trapped here 

2352
02:01:41,233 --> 02:01:43,033
this is a unique opportunity 

2353
02:01:43,033 --> 02:01:44,500
I'm sure you understand

2354
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,700
we are suspicious about a driver being present 

2355
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:53,133
that must be the racist guy 

2356
02:01:53,133 --> 02:01:54,933
...might even be connected

2357
02:01:54,933 --> 02:01:58,300
or not though if you have evidence to the contrary

2358
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:59,800
I'm eager to hear it

2359
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:02,109
as eager as I am to share it

2360
02:02:02,109 --> 02:02:04,407
 lieutenant once the job is done

2361
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:15,966
excellent according to my reports 

2362
02:02:15,966 --> 02:02:19,866
there are at least three lorry drivers lingering near the roundabout

2363
02:02:19,866 --> 02:02:21,844
 hopefully one of them will know something 

2364
02:02:21,844 --> 02:02:25,866
it may come to nothing or it may just blow the case wide open

2365
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:29,282
I can keep the drawbridge up for a few more days at least 

2366
02:02:29,282 --> 02:02:30,966
you should have the time you need 

2367
02:02:30,966 --> 02:02:32,591
in the meantime let me know 

2368
02:02:32,591 --> 02:02:34,766
if there's any other way I may be of assistance 

2369
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:37,850
that's the man who was killed

2370
02:02:39,166 --> 02:02:42,766
I'm afraid this is a discussion for once we've cleared the lynching question

2371
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:43,533
乔伊斯：最好不要本末倒置

2372
02:02:43,533 --> 02:02:45,214
乔伊斯：最好不要本末倒置
so you do know something

2373
02:02:45,214 --> 02:02:46,350
乔伊斯：最好不要本末倒置

2374
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:48,935
I hope there is something else I can help you with 

2375
02:02:48,935 --> 02:02:51,535
she wants to answer the question 

2376
02:02:52,066 --> 02:02:54,125
protocol keeps her from it 

2377
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:54,166
（选项：关于罢工你可以告诉我什么？）
protocol keeps her from it 

2378
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:55,650
（选项：关于罢工你可以告诉我什么？）
everything right up to but not including trade secrets

2379
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:58,533
everything right up to but not including trade secrets

2380
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:04,627
first you'd have to repeal the Emergencies Act of Trade and Aliments 

2381
02:03:04,627 --> 02:03:08,500
that gives me the right to silence it's quite the octopus

2382
02:03:11,666 --> 02:03:13,433
I am glad you see it that way 

2383
02:03:13,433 --> 02:03:16,900
to repeal the act would mean repealing the coalition government 

2384
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:20,700
the one that leases you the right to police west Revachol

2385
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:25,600
I don't like how it's much more capable of 

2386
02:03:26,447 --> 02:03:29,400
speaking intellectually she is than my character

2387
02:03:29,766 --> 02:03:31,765
but I am derailing us 

2388
02:03:31,765 --> 02:03:33,333
you wanted to know about the strike

2389
02:03:33,333 --> 02:03:35,566
she makes me feel incredibly inferior

2390
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,800
I believe the official title is senior labor negotiator 

2391
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:47,542
in practice I'm a grocery clerk 

2392
02:03:47,542 --> 02:03:50,258
I relay the union's demands to wild pines 

2393
02:03:50,258 --> 02:03:52,583
and return with wild pine's counter-offer

2394
02:03:52,583 --> 02:03:53,850
and how are the talks going

2395
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,866
they're not that's the problem 

2396
02:03:57,866 --> 02:04:00,766
the union stopped all negotiations a week ago 

2397
02:04:01,009 --> 02:04:03,266
after that awful lynching took place 

2398
02:04:03,266 --> 02:04:05,746
now they won't even let me into the harbor 

2399
02:04:05,981 --> 02:04:09,481
there's a 2.20m racist behemoth blocking the gates

2400
02:04:09,666 --> 02:04:11,300
 yeah I know about that guy

2401
02:04:11,466 --> 02:04:12,500
what can I say

2402
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:17,648
the union employs a giant covered in tattoos a racist giant 

2403
02:04:17,648 --> 02:04:21,200
I guess that's part of their big tent organization now 

2404
02:04:22,307 --> 02:04:25,638
let's say I was not making the kind of progress I'd hope for

2405
02:04:25,666 --> 02:04:27,366
 when I first arrived

2406
02:04:27,766 --> 02:04:32,133
what's truly at fault is the system that gives her the right to silence exactly 

2407
02:04:32,838 --> 02:04:36,400
maybe I could just take that crowbar and really pry the information out of it

2408
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,066
and when did you first arrive

2409
02:04:38,166 --> 02:04:40,120
I arrived three weeks ago

2410
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:42,133
yes in the middle of February

2411
02:04:42,266 --> 02:04:44,933
the bay was still partially frozen then 

2412
02:04:44,933 --> 02:04:48,466
I prefer to do these things on site like the RCM

2413
02:04:48,566 --> 02:04:51,100
but the strike began in December

2414
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:54,866
I wasn't the original negotiator here

2415
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,533
I took over after Mr. Gaumont hit a wall with Mr. Clare the union boss

2416
02:04:59,533 --> 02:05:02,000
Mr. Clare refused to speak with Gaumont

2417
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,800
despite concessions he granted the union in prior negotiations 

2418
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:08,533
this isn't the first time the union has gone on strike

2419
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:12,065
heavens no there have been two prior strikes 

2420
02:05:12,065 --> 02:05:15,119
both times the union won significant concessions

2421
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:17,860
 including overtime pay and a medical plan 

2422
02:05:18,133 --> 02:05:23,166
this time their demands are more I guess you could say aggressive

2423
02:05:27,333 --> 02:05:28,800
tell me about the union boss

2424
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,566
Evrart is a man of the utmost integrity 

2425
02:05:31,797 --> 02:05:33,900
if you can say one thing about him

2426
02:05:33,933 --> 02:05:36,299
it's that he always puts the interests of the work

2427
02:05:36,299 --> 02:05:37,794
（选项：真的吗？）
 of course not Evrart is fantastically corrupt  

2428
02:05:37,794 --> 02:05:39,822
 of course not Evrart is fantastically corrupt  

2429
02:05:39,822 --> 02:05:44,250
I imagine he has a thick viscous goo where you and I have blood 

2430
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:47,535
he is the most corrupt individual I have ever seen 

2431
02:05:47,535 --> 02:05:50,135
and I deal with men like him for a living 

2432
02:05:50,135 --> 02:05:54,321
if there is anyone more venal more irredeemably nepotistic

2433
02:05:54,321 --> 02:05:56,657
then it's his twin brother Edgar 

2434
02:05:56,657 --> 02:06:01,466
yes Edgar looks exactly like his brother except for that lazy eye 

2435
02:06:01,466 --> 02:06:03,966
he also talks exactly like Evrart does

2436
02:06:04,173 --> 02:06:07,873
 and when one's term as foreman is up the other takes over

2437
02:06:07,873 --> 02:06:10,800
it's how they circumvent the term limits you see 

2438
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,766
with a funny little switcharoo

2439
02:06:13,166 --> 02:06:17,700
while in office they've embezzled god knows how much of their workers dues

2440
02:06:20,466 --> 02:06:21,700
what about the union itself

2441
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:24,531
the union was once a perfectly normal institution

2442
02:06:24,866 --> 02:06:26,466
 20 years ago anyway

2443
02:06:26,466 --> 02:06:30,000
it must not have been easy to establish under the emergency act

2444
02:06:30,133 --> 02:06:32,533
but they did it I can respect that

2445
02:06:32,533 --> 02:06:35,000
 organized labour at its best as they say

2446
02:06:35,837 --> 02:06:38,833
 then something happened in the local chapter elections 

2447
02:06:38,833 --> 02:06:42,031
the brothers Claire came and transformed it into a 

2448
02:06:42,305 --> 02:06:43,265
how do you say 

2449
02:06:43,479 --> 02:06:46,279
a mob the Debardeurs are a crime syndicate 

2450
02:06:46,611 --> 02:06:50,398
sad as it may be I suspect we'll be forced to cooperate with them

2451
02:06:50,398 --> 02:06:52,131
refreshingly honest officer

2452
02:06:53,066 --> 02:06:55,333
the company has tried appeasing in the past

2453
02:06:55,333 --> 02:06:59,933
but I'm afraid our concessions have only emboldened Evrart and his brother

2454
02:07:01,566 --> 02:07:04,123
well of course she's all like praiseworthy to Kim

2455
02:07:05,025 --> 02:07:08,496
 and your opinion detective if I may ask 

2456
02:07:08,652 --> 02:07:11,510
I'm a curious and talkative person you see

2457
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,030
would you say the Debardeurs union is

2458
02:07:19,133 --> 02:07:22,700
I gonna be honest all of this stuff has gone way over my head so

2459
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:28,566
I'm gonna remain neutral

2460
02:07:32,266 --> 02:07:33,533
of course officer

2461
02:07:36,133 --> 02:07:37,600
I just don't have an opinion

2462
02:07:40,766 --> 02:07:41,499
你说选举期间*发生过什么事情？

2463
02:07:41,499 --> 02:07:42,691
你说选举期间*发生过什么事情？
I'm glad you asked

2464
02:07:42,908 --> 02:07:46,492
there was a woman the previous forewoman of the union 

2465
02:07:46,883 --> 02:07:48,310
she disappeared

2466
02:07:49,955 --> 02:07:51,120
disappeard

2467
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:55,900
yes on the last day of the local chapter elections 

2468
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:58,920
her daughter phoned in and said she wasn't running anymore 

2469
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:02,966
or coming to work ever end of story

2470
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,266
remain neutral

2471
02:08:10,566 --> 02:08:13,596
that is suspicious most likely extortion 

2472
02:08:14,032 --> 02:08:17,166
indeed the company suspects foul play

2473
02:08:17,533 --> 02:08:19,150
but there's nothing they could do 

2474
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:20,516
it was a union matter 

2475
02:08:20,566 --> 02:08:22,566
the point of the presentation is 

2476
02:08:22,566 --> 02:08:26,192
these kinds of things happen around the Claiers

2477
02:08:26,192 --> 02:08:27,966
watch out when you're dealing with him

2478
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:30,766
thank you for your concern ma'am we'll be just fine 

2479
02:08:32,333 --> 02:08:36,100
there are leaflets everywhere and banners what did they say again

2480
02:08:36,466 --> 02:08:37,366
oh yes

2481
02:08:37,466 --> 02:08:40,166
every worker a member of the board

2482
02:08:41,666 --> 02:08:43,733
over aggressive commie posturing

2483
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:54,200
seems like they have no idea

2484
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:56,666
...another said demand democracy 

2485
02:08:56,666 --> 02:09:01,366
pretty tame stuff compared to every worker a member of the board 

2486
02:09:02,029 --> 02:09:04,026
fortunately they explained it 

2487
02:09:04,026 --> 02:09:08,300
every time the wild pines group makes a decision about anything

2488
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:14,366
it needs the signature of each of the 2200 workers in its Martinaise Terminal

2489
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,300
just so you understand this is

2490
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:20,575
but 1 of 22 terminals owned by wild pines

2491
02:09:20,575 --> 02:09:24,227
essentially not only are they kings of the company 

2492
02:09:24,277 --> 02:09:29,427
they are also kings of the 72000 employees of wild pines group

2493
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:33,720
I'm not sure

2494
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:36,966
 naturally I assume that was just their opening position 

2495
02:09:36,966 --> 02:09:39,866
a hard nosed tactic with a side of mockery

2496
02:09:40,066 --> 02:09:41,355
but there's been no follow up 

2497
02:09:41,355 --> 02:09:45,289
just the same nonsensical slogan repeated over and over again 

2498
02:09:45,769 --> 02:09:49,166
and now people are getting lynched I hear 

2499
02:09:49,166 --> 02:09:51,044
behind the whirling in rags

2500
02:09:51,279 --> 02:09:54,600
 a disastrous situation if there ever was one

2501
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:57,066
so my characters position on this is

2502
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:03,170
at the end of the day he's a very self centered individual 

2503
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:06,782
and all this other shit is like all right well

2504
02:10:07,252 --> 02:10:09,092
this comes down to what I need

2505
02:10:09,518 --> 02:10:11,518
from this is how to move forward with my thing

2506
02:10:14,666 --> 02:10:16,333
so who do I get a squeeze

2507
02:10:16,333 --> 02:10:17,166
that's all I gotta know

2508
02:10:17,166 --> 02:10:20,866
excuse me from whom did you hear about is lynching

2509
02:10:20,933 --> 02:10:23,863
I first heard it from the boia at the gate

2510
02:10:24,321 --> 02:10:27,655
the one his very name advertises his aversion to work 

2511
02:10:27,850 --> 02:10:30,616
I think he said it was call me Manana

2512
02:10:31,041 --> 02:10:32,307
this checks out

2513
02:10:33,766 --> 02:10:38,800
Mr. Claier told him to how did he put it fuck off midget

2514
02:10:39,466 --> 02:10:41,866
Gaumont is short of stature you see

2515
02:10:43,166 --> 02:10:49,220
yes keep in mind this is a negotiator Mr. Claier has worked with before 

2516
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:52,333
and who was more than fair with him and the union 

2517
02:10:52,333 --> 02:10:55,266
sounds like usual aggressive posture

2518
02:10:57,866 --> 02:10:58,533
乔伊斯：当然 我能提供什么帮助

2519
02:10:58,533 --> 02:10:59,634
乔伊斯：当然 我能提供什么帮助
let's change the subject

2520
02:10:59,634 --> 02:11:00,333
乔伊斯：当然 我能提供什么帮助

2521
02:11:01,466 --> 02:11:02,800
of course detective

2522
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:07,151
all right that was a lot of talking with her 

2523
02:11:07,151 --> 02:11:08,866
I feel like she talks circles around me 

2524
02:11:08,866 --> 02:11:10,666
let's get kim's impression on that

2525
02:11:16,533 --> 02:11:18,766
do I have a level up to do or something

2526
02:11:23,366 --> 02:11:24,566
no I don't okay 

2527
02:11:25,159 --> 02:11:28,300
I did pick up some clothes though I wanted to see

2528
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:34,399
yes now that's a fresh look

2529
02:11:35,416 --> 02:11:37,466
with the gloves and the crowbar

2530
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,000
yes

2531
02:11:45,966 --> 02:11:47,200
what do you want to know

2532
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:54,666
just wondering if he had anything to say about this exchange okay

2533
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:59,066
so we're at another good stopping point for now

2534
02:12:00,733 --> 02:12:06,666
I found myself very sorely shown to be inadequate

2535
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:11,864
in the one thing that my guy is supposed to be good at 

2536
02:12:12,961 --> 02:12:17,032
which is like being persuasive and detecting things 

2537
02:12:17,032 --> 02:12:21,895
and this posh lady just like talk circles around me

2538
02:12:24,066 --> 02:12:27,700
all right I found a thought in the thought cabinet 

2539
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:29,400
what is the thought cabinet

2540
02:12:30,766 --> 02:12:31,666
what is this

2541
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:38,133
plus one empathy towards Kim kitsuragi

2542
02:12:43,133 --> 02:12:44,766
okay we'll investigate that next time

2543
02:12:46,966 --> 02:12:49,300
this game is a mountain of dialogue easy to get lost in

2544
02:12:52,866 --> 02:12:56,900
the dialogue is so good and every character is so well written 

2545
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:59,666
I think that part of the design is probably

2546
02:13:02,133 --> 02:13:08,103
like she hides her intentions behind her

2547
02:13:08,103 --> 02:13:12,311
 intense knowledge of everything that's going on 

2548
02:13:12,311 --> 02:13:16,466
and she's also an authority figure in a person of power as well

2549
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:21,800
concealing character personalities within it as well yeah

2550
02:13:23,366 --> 02:13:26,300
and what I understand your character is desperate for authority and respect

2551
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:29,600
in order to deflect from his inability to look at himself in the mirror yes

2552
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,766
that's perfect

2553
02:13:31,166 --> 02:13:34,933
that's literally perfect because I didn't look in the mirror

2554
02:13:36,566 --> 02:13:38,500
his whole thing is like

2555
02:13:40,466 --> 02:13:43,500
what I am getting out of my character here is that

2556
02:13:45,133 --> 02:13:51,265
inland empire and shivers and this like perception rhetoric 

2557
02:13:51,874 --> 02:13:56,343
he's able to collect knowledge about things like some supernatural

2558
02:13:56,343 --> 02:13:59,466
some very intuitive about people and his environment

2559
02:13:59,466 --> 02:14:02,366
but then he can't really do anything effectively with them

2560
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:08,647
that's like my idea is that as a failed therapist 

2561
02:14:08,647 --> 02:14:14,400
he didn't have enough empathy to know how to like help people

2562
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:16,766
but  he was really good at detecting like

2563
02:14:16,766 --> 02:14:19,600
 people's intentions and their personalities and things 

2564
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:22,466
he just didn't know how to like do anything with it and 

2565
02:14:22,466 --> 02:14:24,900
so he thought maybe it's better to be a cop you know

2566
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:27,800
maybe I can hide behind that like moral disposition

2567
02:14:31,166 --> 02:14:32,166
he's good observer

2568
02:14:32,166 --> 02:14:33,700
but not good at processing it I think

2569
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:35,934
 he's just not good at delivering on it 

2570
02:14:35,934 --> 02:14:40,397
like he has all of this internal knowledge 

2571
02:14:40,397 --> 02:14:42,433
that he can't seem to share with anyone 

2572
02:14:42,433 --> 02:14:48,092
because people either don't get it or he doesn't know how to like use it to his advantage

2573
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:50,026
and it just comes off like

2574
02:14:50,347 --> 02:14:52,600
bing a bit of bumbling and confusing

2575
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:58,300
empathy is useful if you want to know the character 

2576
02:14:58,300 --> 02:14:59,766
behind the mountain of dialogue yeah

2577
02:15:01,933 --> 02:15:06,600
can't even deliver a punch I know it's so pathetic

2578
02:15:07,333 --> 02:15:08,566
oh my god

2579
02:15:12,333 --> 02:15:13,866
he really is pathetic

2580
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:17,600
okay

2581
02:15:18,607 --> 02:15:22,073
I think we'll pause it there for for disco elysium yeah 

2582
02:15:22,073 --> 02:15:24,205
super excited to continue this playthrough

2583
02:15:26,466 --> 02:15:28,600
next time we'll investigate this union and 

2584
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:30,800
kind of see where things lead us there

2585
02:15:31,666 --> 02:15:33,966
bye thank you for watching

2586
02:15:33,966 --> 02:15:35,786
and I will see you next time with more disco
