1
00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:01,491
hello

2
00:00:01,558 --> 00:00:05,691
and welcome to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

3
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:08,291
so on today's episode I'm very excited

4
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:11,644
because we are finally getting to use one of my absolute

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,225
 favorite frameworks for analyzing characters

6
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,591
this is something that I use in therapy from time to time

7
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:24,391
and it's an incredible way to explore patterns of psychology and patterns of behavior

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:29,025
and sort of really uncover what is driving a lot of the complexes

9
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:34,583
that we see play out in Harry's thoughts and his actions

10
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,558
 and the reason we are doing that now is

11
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,049
because we are starting to learn more about ourselves and our past

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,991
 and take another look at that Ledger

13
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,486
and see what do we actually think about the person that we used to be

14
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:49,663
before we became a sorry cop 

15
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:50,591
all that's coming up

16
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,445
so let's jump back in 

17
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:57,125
oh there it is there it is we are back

18
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,425
we're so back

19
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,256
and I'm so excited 

20
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:07,001
okay so we are back in the game now

21
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,291
 I just wanted to say 

22
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:16,291
the community that has arrived around this game and specifically

23
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,225
this playthrough continues to amaze me

24
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:22,958
especially after last episode was like a lot of politics talk

25
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:29,325
and I was very like anxious avoidant of talking about politics

26
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:33,591
I have been very encouraged by the response to that last episode to like

27
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,191
not be so anxious about it

28
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:38,758
I don't I still don't know

29
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,525
if I'm gonna like start getting full political

30
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:47,725
but I will try not to to like avoid it in the game because of my personal 

31
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,191
issues with getting political

32
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:53,591
I'll just say that

33
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,570
I won't let it divert the game

34
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,825
 because at the end of the day I want to talk about like mental health 

35
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:04,525
and there's probably some interesting avenues in the narrative of the game

36
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,069
that will miss out on if I just totally ignore it 

37
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:10,091
however I will say this game is 

38
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,998
so wonderfully designed that you 

39
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,158
you have a main character who has a real backstory 

40
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:20,225
he's not like a blank slate

41
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,958
like I thought that he was gonna be from the beginning

42
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,491
he has his own backstory and at the same time

43
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:30,525
it allows you to have your own beliefs

44
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:36,525
and the character will like have the same behavioral patterns

45
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,891
like genuinely imagine

46
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,847
if like literally Brady was the detective

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,158
 imagine

48
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,251
what you know about me so far 

49
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,025
 I would go about solving a murder

50
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,158
would be exactly like you've seen it

51
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,925
like I would spend crazy amounts of time

52
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:59,851
on things that you just wouldn't like you

53
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:02,558
you wouldn't think I have the significance that they do

54
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,958
and I would be I would totally overlook lots of stuff

55
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,825
and my priorities would just be a total mess

56
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,891
that's why I'm not a detective

57
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:15,991
I genuinely don't think I would be good at it however

58
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,090
I am the detective of the mind

59
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,391
 that's actually something i

60
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:25,758
encourage pretty often to my clients

61
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,993
is to be detectives of their ownminds

62
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,825
because like what does a detective do right

63
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,125
they show up to a crime scene and they do not just immediately

64
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,125
make a claim about like who did it

65
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:41,925
they don't just show up

66
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:46,725
and they're like it was it was the butleror whatever they

67
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:47,625
they canvass the scene

68
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,566
they taking the evidence they talk to witnesses right

69
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,758
and like you should be doing the same thing

70
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,125
when you arrive on the scene of a new emotion

71
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,525
we are like oh that that really made me mad

72
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:02,041
it must be because that person is an idiot

73
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,925
 no like

74
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,891
investigate that a little more right

75
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:11,825
do some detective work of why you might be feeling that way

76
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:14,291
and you know your first impulse may be correct

77
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,725
it may have been the butler but sometimes it is the butler

78
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,525
sometimes you show up to the scene

79
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:24,491
and you realize that you're the murderer

80
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:32,158
which judging by the twists and turns that this game has taken

81
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:35,870
I would not be surprised if we

82
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,143
 killed or were involved in some way in the murder

83
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:42,287
now

84
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,989
I also want to talk about the dream sequence  

85
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:50,291
that we saw at the end of the last episode

86
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,591
I was a little too tired to really talk about it

87
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,933
very haunting scene

88
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:02,706
something that I really took away from it is

89
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:06,191
 like I've been getting the sense 

90
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:11,491
as we wander through Revachol and stumble upon things like

91
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,410
our room 

92
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,292
people we've pissed off our missing gun 

93
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:20,429
the bottles on the roof top and stuff like   

94
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,277
I had the suspicion that we were not happy with who we were

95
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,391
pretty evident right

96
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,797
but the dream sequence scene was like

97
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:35,447
really hammering that home visually for me because  

98
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:40,691
here we have harry hanging from the tree from a disco ball 

99
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,891
which was pretty cool and very thematic

100
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:48,791
and he's talking about he says something like you've

101
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,225
billions of people in the world

102
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,081
and you failed every single one of them

103
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,191
that kind of inner dialogue like

104
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,158
if I'm imagining that

105
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:04,525
this is someone's conceptualization of themselves

106
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,091
this is past harry

107
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:10,560
the drunken hanging corpse 

108
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:16,325
is like who he feels like he was before all of this right 

109
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:21,158
and so genuinely a lot of my work is on 

110
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,859
like reauthoring narratives about yourself and

111
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:29,825
learning to be kind to yourself

112
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:37,177
and so like I think it would be very pertinent to

113
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:40,525
investigate that side of Harry right

114
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,791
like in a therapy session or multiple therapy sessions

115
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,425
like when you the kinds of questions I would ask

116
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:49,958
would be like so let's say harry came in and he said well

117
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,655
I had a dream last night that I was you know

118
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,725
 the hanged man and whatever else

119
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:00,866
you know my line of questioning would be kind of like

120
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:04,491
 what do you feel about this person that you saw

121
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,825
what kinds of ideas do you have about them

122
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,391
you might say well I hate him I'm afraid of him right

123
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,991
this would start putting us on to like well

124
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:16,758
what is your relationship to this person

125
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:20,558
because like there's a very different kind of emotional posture

126
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,158
you could have to say

127
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,491
well I hate that person when I see him hanging from the tree

128
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,791
I feel like he deserves this versus 

129
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:33,025
I feel so sorry for that person

130
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:38,191
when I see him from the hanging from the tree I feel so much regret 

131
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,225
one of those is a path to self empathy

132
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:45,050
right and healing

133
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,225
 and the other one is

134
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:49,358
you just want to forget this person

135
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:54,225
but I don't think that that would be as helpful to just forget

136
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:57,825
we cannot just

137
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,506
one day to the next like 

138
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:02,358
okay well I'm just going to be a different person

139
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:07,291
I think it's fine if he wants to reinvent himself

140
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,125
and be someone new but like

141
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:16,157
part of really making it clear what virtues you want to develop today

142
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:19,225
is knowing specifically the kind of

143
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:23,158
bad qualities you're running away from

144
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:25,347
and if you just close the book and say

145
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:28,391
 no there's nothing worth looking into here I hate that person 

146
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,158
he deserves this

147
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:34,031
then you will miss out on that deeper sense of clarity 

148
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:39,271
to know truly how bad things were 

149
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:42,625
is to give you guidance for what to work on 

150
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,625
and a lot of that is going to come down to learning to love yourself

151
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,025
he is still on his journey of self discovery

152
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,625
which is why we have not looked in the mirror yet

153
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,191
 and I don't think I'm ready to frankly

154
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:05,513
we just saw our past self like hanging from a tree 

155
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:07,521
bloated drunk dying

156
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:14,891
and this was so shocking to myself and my character

157
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:22,491
that I feel like it's the first inclination to wanting to learn more 

158
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:25,625
but we're not ready to to say definitively

159
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:30,975
 like am I happy with the person that I am instead of that person like 

160
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:33,291
 I may look in the mirror

161
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,725
but I just don't think he's ready yet

162
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,991
I know that that's killing some people inside

163
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,125
but this one's really important to me because like

164
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,158
that's one of the first options that you get

165
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,691
and I've approached it several times

166
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:52,958
and I just got the feeling that like it's not time

167
00:09:55,891 --> 00:10:00,825
maybe you‘re a vampire could be I love that the game is giving me the option

168
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:05,525
question how do you interpret dreams in your profession

169
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,972
that's a good question I don't generally like I'm not a 

170
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,991
 the one reason I don't is because I'm not like an expert on dreams

171
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:13,825
by any means

172
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,791
if someone comes into the session

173
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,191
and they are talking about a dream and

174
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,125
I guess my approach to dreams is like

175
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:30,291
let's say I'm working with someone on their relationship with their mom 

176
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:33,991
and then they come in and they're like I had a dream about mom

177
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:34,791
I'm like okay well

178
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,975
let's that's good like let's process that 

179
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:41,625
what did it feel like what was the situation

180
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,591
in the dream why do you think your mind was going there all these things right

181
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,125
I guess what I'm saying is that

182
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:59,198
my intention to analyze dreams is when there is like 

183
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:03,225
already context to that subject in the sessions 

184
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:06,800
if someone comes into my therapy session is like

185
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,791
 so last night I had a dream where and they just start telling me randomly random stuff 

186
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:13,791
and it's not related to anything that we're working on

187
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,225
I'm not gonna like

188
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:19,158
so let's unpack that you know what I mean

189
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:23,125
but yeah I don't know

190
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,991
I'm not like super well versed on like what things mean

191
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm more I will unpack it to say like 

192
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,091
okay so you had a dream that

193
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,391
you were in an argument with your mom

194
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:41,891
and she was wearing your shoes like

195
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:42,758
I don't know whatever

196
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:43,958
this is random stuff

197
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,725
what does it make you feel to talk about that right now

198
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:49,900
like I'm gonna bring it present

199
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:53,125
 I'm not going to be able to make an objective analysis about what it means

200
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,425
what I can do is grapple with like well what does it mean to you

201
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,291
that you saw this

202
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,191
like what do you interpret from it and is that useful

203
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:01,625
sometimes it is

204
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,825
okay so we are on day two finally

205
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:11,491
and it is once again my objective to

206
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:15,158
progress the game and solve the murder

207
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:18,991
we have to solve this murder

208
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,491
good morning Kim

209
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:27,625
let's get him involved for this sprightly morning

210
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:30,025
morning

211
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:32,891
love it love it

212
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,891
just one of those quick nod

213
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,358
I've got some good news

214
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,350
I took care of the body 

215
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,691
the thought of him decomposing in my mc

216
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,619
wouldn't let me sleep

217
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,091
I took care of the body

218
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,876
yeah I know we missed out on some of that narrative 

219
00:12:55,876 --> 00:13:00,800
but I'm I'm okay with that good 

220
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,625
well let's see what happens

221
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,475
I don't know if I was ready to let him go

222
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:06,958
 well he's in processing now

223
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,825
we have other matters to attend to

224
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:09,725
 I'm okay with that

225
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:12,358
he kind of wishes you'd acknowledge this contribution

226
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,628
but you've missed your opportunity now 

227
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,491
fuck

228
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:23,225
now I'm invested in like being Kim around a good trajectory  

229
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,045
now I'm worried about disappointing him further

230
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,291
the union muscle finally turned up

231
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,591
and he looked rowdy

232
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,866
we need to talk to them 

233
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:32,625
okay

234
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:36,958
what do you mean rowdy

235
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,350
I mean ungovernable 

236
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,325
Martinaise isn't exactly enthusiastic about the RCM being here

237
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,904
they prefer to be policed by the union

238
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:48,691
these men here men who drink beer for breakfast

239
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:52,891
there's talk of an armed wing of the union called the hardy boys

240
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:55,030
who are responsible for sage policing 

241
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,225
I think it's them

242
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,958
that's a great word ungovernable

243
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,191
well look that's what happens in real life sometimes 

244
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,491
you you say something with one intention 

245
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,958
and then the other person like

246
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:14,391
you read into it that they are disappointed in your response

247
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:17,725
and then you just have to move on that's just life

248
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,358
why do we need to talk to them

249
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:24,525
everything points to the Duckworkers’ union

250
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,625
the belt used for hanging him 

251
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,625
tracks in the mud

252
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,491
the circumstances in Martinaise

253
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,450
my preliminary information 

254
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,758
which may of course all be wrong

255
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,328
but we still need to talk to them and it won't be easy

256
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:37,991
 okay

257
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,158
are these the men Garte told us about

258
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:41,325
I completely forgot

259
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,000
sorry I had a rough night sleep 

260
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,825
it's them by the looks of it

261
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,291
loud and nasty

262
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,625
just like the manager said

263
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:53,125
so Kim may have been having some of his own disturbing dreams

264
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,125
one loose thread less to worry about

265
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:57,358
and one big problem to replace it

266
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,091
okay

267
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:00,158
there are so many of them

268
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:01,925
maybe we should call in reinforcements

269
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:04,025
that would just escalate tensions

270
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,979
no captain would sign off on it

271
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:07,325
 solving one murder

272
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:10,891
isn't worth a conflict between the rcm and the Debardeurs' union

273
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,645
in fact even the *death* of two detectives 

274
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,691
might not warrant an all-out war

275
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:18,825
so let's keep a cool head okay

276
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:21,691
okay kim has telling me to keep a cool head

277
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:28,025
let's see how that goes exaggerating about that mortal danger

278
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,125
just calmly factoring it in

279
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,791
your fist clench and your pulse rises uncomfortably

280
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,525
why why *half light* do I

281
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,891
am I scared I'm scared of what's gonna happen

282
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:43,891
I'm scared of myself

283
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:47,891
that I won't be able to control my urges to fight them

284
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:48,439
let's roll 

285
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:49,816
one more thing before we do

286
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,459
we don't have to talk to them immediately we can walk right past them

287
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,950
continue with our business 

288
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,191
oh okay

289
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,875
so we can go on a bit of a side quest to binge I guess 

290
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,125
good a power move

291
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,925
purposefully concentrate on something else first

292
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,513
look I love a good power move

293
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:13,575
yeah streetwise zoom right past do it on your own terms 

294
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,600
yeah boy

295
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,375
they are in no hurry to leave they think they own the place

296
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,141
anyway I leave that choice to you

297
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,657
whatever you decide is fine by me

298
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:31,691
look I I want to progress the storyline

299
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,441
but I also have a lot of things I need to do

300
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:38,191
there are so many things okay

301
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,391
we're not obsessed with getting our smokes

302
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,091
we've sort of resolved that one

303
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,759
I'm gonna need some more money

304
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,225
 I'm sure we'll find that along the way 

305
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:54,748
I need to make a truce with Cuno 

306
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:56,291
that's a priority

307
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,891
that's a big priority for me

308
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:02,700
I have to offer him something so

309
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:06,466
I don't have that book in my possession

310
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,816
it's the jam mystery

311
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,725
there's a lot of things I could do

312
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:21,958
I mean

313
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,558
I guess none of these are really a priority

314
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:32,958
let's see what lena's up to

315
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,001
let's get her perspective on all this 

316
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,125
just a moment

317
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,400
and there's no public phones nearby

318
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,516
the closest phone booth is down the coast

319
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:45,825
sorry for the inconvenience ma'am

320
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,375
that's not just an inconvenience friend

321
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:56,225
you better not do anything to make lena's day any worse 

322
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:59,925
it's fine I understand thank you anyway

323
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,991
I'm glad to see you again dear

324
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:04,533
she's so understanding

325
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:09,291
 the lady is distressed perhaps something more upbeat might cheer her up

326
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,558
howdy Lena what's kicking no

327
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:17,758
why is it giving me options to say these things

328
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,091
good day ma'am everything all right

329
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:24,891
sorry ma'am I didn't mean to eavestrap on your conversation

330
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:26,158
tell me how I might make it up to you

331
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:28,340
that's very polite that's very sorry cop

332
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:29,525
let's go with that

333
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,825
please don't trouble yourself about me sweetie

334
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,958
I was just hoping to make a call

335
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,425
but the whirling's phone line isn't working

336
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:42,825
thank you thank you for subbing with prime

337
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:44,758
that's very much appreciated

338
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,791
the union office probably has a phone

339
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,725
but I can't really get there

340
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,291
or to the phone booth down the coast

341
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:54,466
and Gary's phone is dead too

342
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:56,301
what's wrong with the phone line

343
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:56,910
who did this 

344
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,591
the manager was vague about it

345
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:00,366
he was vague you say

346
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,396
now I gotta ask the question

347
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,091
 why did you need to use the phone

348
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:08,255
to let the young woman whose house sitting for us

349
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,000
 know that we may be delayed

350
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,158
Morell my husband and our friend Gary

351
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,275
were supposed to get back by Monday night

352
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:19,025
but they're still missing and I haven't heard from them

353
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,758
interesting okay

354
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:27,689
so Gart may be involved in their disappearance 

355
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,325
I don't know

356
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,860
look you gotta ask yourself who benefits 

357
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,425
 in times like this

358
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:35,043
the phone line just suddenly goes down

359
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:38,691
right when sweet Lena needs it come on now

360
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:43,791
I don't see how those dots connect naturally

361
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,591
I was also hoping she'd heard from Morell

362
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,892
you hear that someone's missing 

363
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,525
there could be foul play afoot

364
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:55,358
I knew it I knew it

365
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,625
I love missing persons cases

366
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:00,816
that's right

367
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,474
now skip the foreplay 

368
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:04,791
time to dive into the dark alleys

369
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,891
start shaking down the usual suspects

370
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,620
you know legwork

371
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,229
 yes

372
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:13,566
doing some good will alleviate the hangover

373
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:16,766
at least you're of use to someone

374
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:18,730
 thank you volition

375
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,691
I appreciate the encouragement

376
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,625
this sounds more like a side thing

377
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,003
I need to take care of my main thing

378
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,325
no this is the main thing right now

379
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,225
okay I'll bite

380
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,091
has your husband gone missing before

381
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:38,725
that's just it this isn't like him at all

382
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:42,425
He always plans his expeditions so carefully

383
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,991
a cold breeze hisses through dense thickets of reeds

384
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,191
something sweet in it somnolent

385
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:53,385
a damp chill goes down your spine 

386
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,725
when you look around

387
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:57,558
you're still in the whirling in rags

388
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,291
but you have more important things to worry about

389
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,958
don't don't do that to yourself Lena tell me more

390
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,053
what was this expedition he was on

391
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,746
 just some field work sweetie 

392
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:15,725
Morell is a highly trained scientist

393
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,558
he and his assistant Gary

394
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:21,891
are studying an extremely rare species of insect

395
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,158
they should have returned by now

396
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,491
they were just going down the coast

397
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:29,725
across the waterlock to set a few traps

398
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:32,758
he said they'd be back on Monday

399
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:36,991
oh shit so they've been missing for like

400
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:39,625
some time

401
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:43,491
hmm

402
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:46,391
who's this Gary person

403
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:47,491
sweetie

404
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,691
it's nothing like that

405
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,929
Gary's as loyal as they come

406
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,366
 I trust him with my husband's life any day

407
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,958
what about the traps

408
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,291
I doubt it sweetie

409
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:02,525
the traps aren't big enough for humans to get caught in them

410
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:03,922
they're for the inset

411
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:05,958
 anyway

412
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,625
do it find him

413
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,025
this will surely lead to a mystery with that extremely rare insect

414
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,491
this sounds like police business

415
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:14,720
I'll help you find your husband

416
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,025
are you sure we have time to go chasing after bug-hunters just now

417
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:20,408
I did suggest we played cool but

418
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,791
Kim you just told me

419
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,125
this is part of my power play okay

420
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:28,791
look the union guys

421
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,525
they're a rowdy bunch okay

422
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:31,625
they're muscle men

423
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:38,584
what better way can I show my my prowess  

424
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:43,358
then helping this poor lady with her issue

425
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:49,325
it's just a little side thing we'll do it down the line

426
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:53,991
I've already given my word I'm honor-bound (to up hold it)

427
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,325
honor bound sounds pretty cool

428
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,991
but that sounds kind of like a like

429
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:00,825
an excuse

430
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,391
the scientists could be connected to our main case

431
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:07,025
that could be true

432
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:11,725
I know he tells me don't worry like do whatever you want

433
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,184
then he's like 

434
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,325
sorry friend is that really worth your time right now yes 

435
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:17,558
it's just police work

436
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,673
hmm it's just a little side thing we'll do it down the line

437
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,234
if you say so 

438
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:29,569
that sigh is very unappreciated at this time

439
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:31,991
 oh thank you officers truly 

440
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:35,491
I'll be right here if you come across any sound of Morell

441
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,991
the waterlock on the canal is broken

442
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,958
so your husband is probably just stuck on the other side of the coast 

443
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,214
that's good intuition 

444
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:46,125
oh my what happened to the waterlock 

445
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,190
probably just some technical problem 

446
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,001
well whatever the cause I'm thankful 

447
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,358
to both of you 

448
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,925
you've spared me another sleepless night

449
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,550
you're welcome ma'am

450
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,910
I hate to ask

451
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,025
but if your investigation takes you to the other side of the coast

452
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:04,422
please do keep an eye out for my husband 

453
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:06,025
and if you see him

454
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:09,525
let him know Lena is waiting for him here at the whirling

455
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:12,791
he gets so tangled up in his work that he may not know

456
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,725
the water lock's been repaired

457
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,558
and it's cold out there

458
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,909
if I see him I'll let him know you're here

459
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:23,158
 oh you're such a dear 

460
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,091
thank you sweetie

461
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:27,475
let's find out more is he some kind of scientist 

462
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:30,691
oh yes a zoologist 

463
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:33,971
a cryptozoologist to be more precise 

464
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:36,008
what is a cryptozoologist

465
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,925
it's absudoscience

466
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:40,344
that attempts to legitimize research

467
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:43,691
 into mythological beasts and urban legends 

468
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:47,167
he does sound unimpressed

469
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,791
 that's one opinion yes

470
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:53,100
and people are entitled to their opinions

471
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:59,816
ah shit okay so there's some tension between Kim and Lena 

472
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:03,241
 my two loves why

473
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:07,158
I thought you guys said this was about a detective in a murder case

474
00:25:07,158 --> 00:25:09,966
no one told me this was gonna be a fucking love triangle 

475
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:13,925
my apologies ma'am I did not mean to undermine your hobby

476
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:14,853
he is just jealous

477
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:17,916
 he's jealous that Lena and I have a budding trusting friendship

478
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,091
 and that he and I are still on our first date 

479
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:24,335
it's not a hobby deer 

480
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:26,925
it's a subfield of zoology

481
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:31,625
one specializing in animal species that are so exceedingly rare

482
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:35,917
that many assume them to be extinct or even fictitious 

483
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:38,558
Kim I can't believe you just called it a hobby

484
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,375
searching for such species called crypteds

485
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,525
is difficult and often thankless

486
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,997
and frankly many scientists are too lazy to do it 

487
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:55,025
universities these days are rarely interested in supporting real research 

488
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:58,358
okay see this is where the detective work comes in all right

489
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:04,225
Lena is looking for the cryptids her her husband he's a

490
00:26:04,225 --> 00:26:06,525
he's a bonafide scientist man

491
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:13,891
he is looking into the mystery of some sort of spectacular insect creature 

492
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:15,600
and he is gone missing

493
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,825
this time I really do wonder like no memes

494
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:22,325
like who benefits

495
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:24,132
legitimately like who would 

496
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:28,525
who is trying to stop the discovery of this 

497
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:31,391
a new species of bug

498
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,722
you just gotta act like you cannot 

499
00:26:35,722 --> 00:26:38,491
you cannot go through this without asking that question 

500
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,958
she's completely internalized her husband's struggles

501
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:44,091
they are her own

502
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:48,391
maybe you should convince her to tell you about some cool cryptids

503
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:53,358
well that's yeah now that she's less worried about her husband

504
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:56,325
tell me more about this rare insect

505
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,458
oh sweetie it's fascinating 

506
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:02,358
I shouldn't bore you with entomological minutiae

507
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,891
the lieutenant gives you a sideways glance

508
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:10,625
I don't like that I don't like being ch- like forced to pick

509
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:17,391
I want to make Lena happy but not at the cost of kim's patience

510
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:22,425
no I want to hear about the insect 

511
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:25,325
Kim this is interesting okay

512
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,762
this is the this is police work play along

513
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:32,191
 well it's a phasmid technically but

514
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,391
oh yeah here comes the interesting

515
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:40,391
other phasmids imitate sticks or leaves

516
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,391
this one's a living reed

517
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,158
it disguises itself among the reeds here on the Insilindian coast 

518
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:50,666
it's named the insilindian phasmid

519
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:54,991
perhaps you'll end up co-discovering the phasmids with us officers

520
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,138
I'm sure Kim would enjoy that

521
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:02,025
there's a touch of awe in the way she enunciated the creature's name

522
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:03,391
I knew it

523
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:07,232
we're gonna be chasing made of insects with cryptozoologies

524
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:08,025
 yes

525
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:09,891
it's not made up officer

526
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,675
I can assure you

527
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:16,158
there's a hint of defensiveness to her retort but also confidence

528
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:19,191
she seems to sit up a little straighter in her chair

529
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:20,225
there's the power play

530
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,358
it's simply elusive

531
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:27,350
so much so that most establishment zoologist doubted exists at all

532
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,400
um is it dangerous

533
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,675
not at all why else would it hide itself so carefully

534
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,495
Is it valuable

535
00:28:37,495 --> 00:28:41,591
 I doubt it no one gets into cryptozoology for the money

536
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:43,399
does it have cool powers

537
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:48,425
yes it can blend in almost perfectly among the reeds 

538
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,491
it's how it stayed hidden all these years

539
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:52,825
centuries even

540
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:58,091
look okay aside from like whether this thing is real or not

541
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,591
this is all she has

542
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:04,191
like let her enjoy this

543
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,325
what makes you think it's around

544
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:11,133
some teenagers making out in the reed saw one

545
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,225
they didn't know what it was of course

546
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:16,525
but there was a brief article in a local newspaper

547
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:21,950
about their encounter with a ghost insect that looks like the reeds 

548
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,376
Gary sent us the clipping

549
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,491
 was Gary real Lena

550
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,225
or did you fabricate him

551
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:28,875
as well

552
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,958
 of course most phasmid sidings turn out to be false alarms

553
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:37,291
but their description matched the insulindian phasmid perfectly

554
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:39,733
and they didn't even know what they were looking at okay

555
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,122
okay so what's so special about this stick bug

556
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:45,191
I'm afraid I'm not explaining this very well

557
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,425
it is very special

558
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,791
that's painful

559
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,591
that's the worst thing when you're like really excited about something 

560
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:56,225
and you're trying to talk to someone and they just don't care

561
00:29:57,591 --> 00:29:58,391
it's sick

562
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,693
there are some parts of you that are so innocent 

563
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:08,325
that are not worth being embarrassed about 

564
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,700
you know if you like something 

565
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,125
like enjoy it

566
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:20,565
don't feel like you have to censor your enjoyment 

567
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,466
because of the embarrassment

568
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm saying this out loud

569
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,400
because that's something I also need to hear myself sometimes  

570
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,200
Morell can explain it all much better

571
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,766
I wish you could hear him describe it 

572
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,800
then you'd understand I'm sure 

573
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:37,100
tell me about some cool cryptids

574
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:40,466
there's really no point in manipulating anyone 

575
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,575
she'd be only too pleased to tell you about her work 

576
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,933
go on and ask 

577
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,933
hey Lena I'd like to hear about some of the cryptids you've studied 

578
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:50,000
could you just tell me a couple of them  

579
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,675
oh I'd be delighted 

580
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:55,450
truth be told I could really use the company too 

581
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,970
one *cryptid* not a couple one

582
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:02,250
this won't turn into some kind of cryptid extravaganza 

583
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,375
okay Kim just one little kryptid promise  

584
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:07,366
he nods and assumes awaiting posture

585
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,333
I love this little triangle

586
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,950
I don't know I don't know why  

587
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,766
they decided to make the relationships like this

588
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:19,400
but I'm enjoying it 

589
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:24,841
cryptids cryptids let's hear about all the interesting cryptids 

590
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,500
what's the biggest cryptid

591
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,966
that would be the Giant of Koko Nur

592
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:31,475
okay

593
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:36,175
the Giant lives in the most arid parts of the vast Koko Nur desert

594
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,000
in south salsamara

595
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,366
casting a strange light across the barren wastes

596
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:41,925
how big is it 

597
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:43,466
no one knows for sure

598
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,275
it is like an *awful* mountain appearing from below the horizon 

599
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:52,650
and expanding to cover almost a third of your field of vision  

600
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,300
is it dangerous

601
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,700
 luminosity of Koko Nur is a bad omen in local folklore

602
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:02,525
some say it's a fata morgana

603
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:05,333
others a fate unimaginable

604
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:06,600
hooey

605
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,700
no animal can be that large

606
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:10,133
it's a mirage

607
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:13,333
that's what makes it so peculiar

608
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,933
a species surviving at the very limits of scientific law

609
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,500
the Giant of Koko Nur must be the largest animal the planet can support

610
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,166
let her dream Kim

611
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:31,133
there are limits you see to how large metabolism and ecosystem can beget 

612
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,275
some say a gravity anomaly below the Koko Nur desert 

613
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:40,466
might allow the creature to grow to these *gargantuan* sizes 

614
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,300
so so because the folklore doesn't make sense

615
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,566
you also need to like invent a secondary

616
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:54,300
abstract explanation to justify it this is interesting

617
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,699
great this is great shit you need more

618
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,900
yeah what's the littlest cryptid just one more 

619
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,566
hey you promised you'd only ask about one cryptid

620
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,766
but Kim don't *you* want to hear about another cryptid

621
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,656
right okay we can move on for now 

622
00:33:13,656 --> 00:33:16,375
it'd be dishonorable to renege on the promise 

623
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,000
I guess that's true look I'm

624
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,733
I'm hanging on for dear life here with Kim

625
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,775
I don't want to disappoint him 

626
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,666
he nods approvingly

627
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:26,925
okay

628
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:30,466
maybe when maybe when Kim is busy

629
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,600
we can come back and hear more about the cryptids Lena

630
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:34,450
I'm gonna leave 

631
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,500
Lena

632
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:40,566
okay

633
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,725
no more distractions

634
00:33:55,425 --> 00:34:00,533
okay let's just I mean I guess I don't really need to do any of this stuff first 

635
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,133
I can just ask them

636
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,800
because maybe that'll give me some more direction as well  

637
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,766
let me handle this

638
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,350
detective disorientated 

639
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,166
are you still wondering where you are

640
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,825
this is Martinez in case you forgotten  

641
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,533
I advise you not to overstay your welcome

642
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,733
you're the gardener right

643
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,666
no I am not a gardener

644
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:29,566
I'm a legal counselor for the dog workers union

645
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,266
what you lied to me

646
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:35,400
so let's get to it you're looking for Titus Hardie

647
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,525
you think he has information that will help you 

648
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,375
maybe he does 

649
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:43,325
I've been manipulated again 

650
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:45,600
that's Titus talk to him

651
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,750
but know this I'll be keeping an eye on you 

652
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:52,133
no strong-arming nothing official 

653
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,350
the district of Martinaise does not recognize your authority to make arrests 

654
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:58,666
what I can't just arrest anyone that I want

655
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:01,600
it doesn't matter if you recognize our authority

656
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,725
we will make an arrest if we have to 

657
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,500
fucking that's right Kim

658
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,375
she says nothing her glare speaks for her 

659
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,900
fucking kim's got my back 

660
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:15,566
you're sure Easy Leo mentioned something about a lawyer Elizabeth someone 

661
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,125
but you're too dumb to remember what it was 

662
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
god damn it my brain is like 

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,933
it's so poor it detecting simple things

664
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:34,775
umm

665
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,325
what's your role in all of this how do you benefit  

666
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:42,050
like I already told you I'm a legal counselor  

667
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,750
do you have hearing problems 

668
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,375
I I

669
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:52,300
like one thing I am already having a hard time bearing with is how stupid I am

670
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,800
I do not insult me as well

671
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,100
my character is very fragile

672
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,250
that's one of the things that I think is actually really tangible about  

673
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,573
what my character would be going through  

674
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,133
becoming a sorry cop finally facing 

675
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,491
the very negative picture you have of yourself in your own mind

676
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,966
they are evidence that the character is like interested in

677
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,133
developing a more realistic view of himself right

678
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:42,325
and that's actually something that comes through in this kind of work 

679
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,533
when I'm talking about like

680
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,200
the narrative process that I see 

681
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,275
is you go through identity deconstruction and then reconstruction

682
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:55,966
and deconstruction looks like

683
00:36:57,275 --> 00:36:59,575
listening to feedback right  

684
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:01,350
hearing what people have to say 

685
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,766
good bad critical praiseworthy whatever 

686
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,000
you're integrating everything

687
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,900
you're allowing yourself to be exposed to

688
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,100
as many views of yourself as there can be right 

689
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,500
because the whole issue with narrative

690
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,466
is often that like we only view one storyline of our life

691
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,100
and so we want to acknowledge as many as we can right

692
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,000
before we start reconstructing the identity

693
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,435
with something that's 

694
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,366
maybe not more positive but is more realistic 

695
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:40,200
so you have to be able to listen to what people have to say about you 

696
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,566
you have to be able to integrate that with what you think about yourself 

697
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:46,500
Harry does not really know what he thinks about himself

698
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,466
but he doesn't like being called stupid

699
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,700
and he doesn't like when people insult him

700
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,566
which is a good sign

701
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:58,625
because it means he is in some ways protective of like who he is being

702
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,775
he doesn't want Kim to think he's too distracted 

703
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:09,175
he doesn't want Lena to think that she is delusional

704
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:15,733
the concern that I am having about how people perceive me

705
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:22,000
is evidence of the deconstruction process right 

706
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,200
raise my arms 

707
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,500
I mean I guess that could be a power play

708
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,075
what if I want to talk to *you* not Titus I am talking to you  

709
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:38,966
she's going to say you are talking to me 

710
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,625
what you want is of no significance *officer*

711
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,500
don't test your authority

712
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,425
in Martinez you are no one 

713
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,850
fucking let's go authority chime in  

714
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:52,766
I saw what you were thinking

715
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:56,500
you want to say what are you going to *do* to me

716
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:57,325
yeah

717
00:38:57,325 --> 00:39:01,100
don't just because it's in your head doesn't mean you have to say it

718
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,566
fucking yeah right

719
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:06,733
you will not use out on anything good by not saying it

720
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,900
okay interesting little flip here 

721
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,175
like Authority is being the more reserved 

722
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:22,166
and Volition is telling me to say it anyways 

723
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:25,325
what are you going to do to me 

724
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:26,150
hmh

725
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,200
what are we going to do to you

726
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,900
shit

727
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Volition you have steered me wrong why did you do this

728
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,600
you were specifically asked *not* to say that 

729
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,900
and then you said it anyway

730
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,800
you junior delinquent

731
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:43,775
but you still did

732
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,600
the union isn't going to *do* anything to you

733
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,566
it is not a crime syndicate it is a labor organization

734
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,075
we're stumbling through every 

735
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:58,700
look I it's in character our guy is like 

736
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,500
 he's trying to be an Authority figure but he's a total failure at it  

737
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,733
we failed with Cuno

738
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,566
we failed with Joyce

739
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:11,766
we pretty much failed with Evart Claire like

740
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,566
and we fail here again like

741
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,850
it is so within our character to keep doing this 

742
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:19,133
god damn right it is 

743
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,825
which is don't have the intellect 

744
00:40:21,825 --> 00:40:25,933
if anything it is the RCM who *do* things to people 

745
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,775
but we digress 

746
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:29,066
why are you so aggressive 

747
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:32,278
aggressive you make your living enforcing violence

748
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,100
these people are just *duck workers*

749
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,900
hmh so you were spying on us 

750
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,135
and now you represent murder suspects 

751
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:42,133
*just dock workers*

752
00:40:43,466 --> 00:40:46,300
listen you Moralintern lackeys

753
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:51,066
you're a mob enforcing the unlawful privatization of Revachol

754
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:54,333
twenty fat men in the Occident are stealing it all

755
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:56,125
and you're their bodyguards 

756
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,766
fuck yeah

757
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:00,425
hmm 

758
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:04,425
so ask what you came to ask or get back to your commanders

759
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:09,566
ah fuck this looks like politics stuff

760
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:20,400
let's take it a step further armed uprising 

761
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,475
where are the union's plans uhhhh

762
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,366
yeah let's ask those questions

763
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:37,504
that's another thing I'm warming it up I'm warming up to it  

764
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,866
okay let's do it all right 

765
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:42,300
this is that was just a test okay

766
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,975
what I what I'm doing is I'm playing them 

767
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:46,550
I want them to see that 

768
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:51,966
I have no game and now their defenses are not up

769
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:57,100
this is a strategic police work in action

770
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,933
this is where you say your bit

771
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:05,200
let's let's keep it together

772
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:10,866
he's used to giving orders and having them obeyed immediately

773
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,875
you should not indulge him 

774
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:13,225
okay 

775
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:14,100
detective

776
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,755
the lieutenant acknowledges you with a sharp note

777
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:18,600
 he's leaving it to you  

778
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,025
precinct 57th's finest scans the room  

779
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:24,025
leaving the speaking to you 

780
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:25,194
he trusts you 

781
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,775
maybe against his better judgment but he does 

782
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,933
okay 

783
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:31,941
got kim's trust

784
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,666
don't say anything yet okay

785
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:37,300
we've been down this path before

786
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,900
hey hey dipshit you hard of hearing or something   

787
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,700
the boss man's talking to you 

788
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,200
fuck off cross your arms

789
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,775
what is he fucking kidding

790
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:51,866
this guy high or something

791
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:56,625
hey asshole up here we're talking to you  

792
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,766
we are looking for Titus Hardie

793
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,066
um

794
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,934
no we're not gonna we're not gonna feed the troll

795
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:07,333
 we're not gonna get into their attitude 

796
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,533
let's get straight to the business here

797
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,575
we need to talk about the man hanged out back 

798
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:15,533
oh this is about him

799
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:18,825
a real looker that one

800
00:43:18,825 --> 00:43:21,300
you sure took your time huh  

801
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,950
waited for him to get real ripe and pretty for you 

802
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,266
oh he was a real pretty boy hanging up there 

803
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,366
letting out that *pretty-boy smell*

804
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,766
I can't for the life of me understand why you did it

805
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:40,166
I mean I would have just left him up there

806
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:44,966
you must really like cleaning up other people's shit

807
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,700
you might want to start asking your questions now

808
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:56,450
it's not going to get better than this 

809
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,100
I don't like being

810
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,377
these guys are so macho they're ready to confess to first-degree murder

811
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,700
ask if it was them

812
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,675
there's too many there's too many people 

813
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:08,366
I feel like I'm being triangulated

814
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,550
let's scan the room let's get a scope on this 

815
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:19,675
starting from the right boot size 44 blond man in his thirties

816
00:44:19,675 --> 00:44:21,725
overbearingly masculine 

817
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:22,200
okay

818
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:29,350
sitting on his right standard working boots size 45 or 46 

819
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:33,066
eldest in the room probably mid-fifties

820
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,150
smoker quiet 

821
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,533
across at the other table

822
00:44:37,766 --> 00:44:42,950
hobnailed working boots size 43 gang tattoos 

823
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:48,208
Mesque or Saramirizian in his late thirtirs/early forties

824
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:51,125
a symmetric burn on his neck 

825
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,500
resembling the letters *Los Los*

826
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,866
has he tried to burn it off

827
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,816
leave that life behind

828
00:44:58,066 --> 00:45:05,366
and then standard working boot steel reinforced toes size 46

829
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,275
the big dick wide at the shoulders and lean at the hips  

830
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,375
rugby cap fingerless gloves 

831
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:17,375
and numerous scars a little under forty

832
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:21,066
the emblem on his vest says Rowing club 

833
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,375
a little patch below it reads T. Hardie Captain 

834
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,825
in the far corner standard working boot 

835
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:33,333
steel reinforced toes size 44 

836
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,300
forty-something non-alcoholic beverage in hand

837
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:40,500
(you squint) is that a *plectrum*

838
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,675
what is a plectrum

839
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,533
on his neck forget it

840
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,575
it's not important

841
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:53,466
 size 41 with the light step

842
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,350
not a child after all

843
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,666
an older man with a rat face

844
00:45:57,733 --> 00:46:01,700
mean watery eyes and two front teeth miss him

845
00:46:01,966 --> 00:46:03,350
the whole gang is here

846
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:08,666
 in the middle heaving and wheezing big guy boot size 46 

847
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:12,495
deep marks probably carried the victim over

848
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:15,374
he alone is 130 kilos  

849
00:46:15,374 --> 00:46:17,600
add the man in armor

850
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,600
and you could easily exceed 220

851
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,800
in conclusion

852
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:24,700
these seven are the actors on the crime scene

853
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:26,700
the footprints were theirs

854
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:28,550
but there's a discrepancy 

855
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,700
can I not just arrest all of them

856
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,300
right now it's pretty evident that they did it

857
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:36,166
it's probably more to the story than that

858
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,000
but I want to exert my authority

859
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,533
exactly you've stood there for about four seconds 

860
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,275
not saying anything 

861
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:46,325
hit them with questions 

862
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:48,425
where's the eighth Hardie

863
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:49,525
let's do it

864
00:46:49,525 --> 00:46:50,866
the fuck is with you fella

865
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,275
the hanged man in the back yard did you do it

866
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:01,333
or no let's just say let's go straight for it

867
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,666
I found eight sets of footprints

868
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,005
but there's only seven of you

869
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,366
 what are you talking about madman

870
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,933
there's no eighth Hardie boy

871
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:11,100
there's seven of us and we're all here

872
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,125
or what 

873
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,950
you want to be the eighth Hardie boy

874
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,025
we ain't hiring

875
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:17,300
we could have been

876
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:18,150
we could have been

877
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,200
actually boss we've been talking

878
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,075
and we think she could maybe 

879
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:23,966
this person Glen wants to hire

880
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,475
he really respects her

881
00:47:26,475 --> 00:47:27,084
 she

882
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,522
so there's an eighth Hardie and it's a Hardie girl 

883
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,263
who might it be Elizabeth the gardener

884
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,400
shut the fuck up Glen

885
00:47:37,966 --> 00:47:40,004
I do talking here

886
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:42,800
 now what the fuck do you want cop

887
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,500
so let me get this straight

888
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:47,266
there is an eighth Hardie boy it's a she

889
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:48,966
and you don't like us talking about her

890
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,666
that's that's good insight

891
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:53,466
that's right we're not talking about this

892
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:56,050
this is a private Hardie boys matter 

893
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,258
nothing to do with your shit

894
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:01,133
and you're not cops here

895
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,133
don't go digging around

896
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,866
if you don't want a bullet in the back of your head

897
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,825
I'm watching you

898
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:10,750
good we are all watching each other 

899
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,675
officer your question 

900
00:48:12,675 --> 00:48:15,575
there's no pushing further he thinks

901
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:17,250
this is already a victory

902
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,925
we'll learn more about this 8th Hardie sooner or later

903
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:26,733
all right that was the first good double team that we've had

904
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:31,533
fucking power dynamics all over the place

905
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,333
interesting

906
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:40,000
what do we got up here

907
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,675
photos of men and overalls toting guns and union placards

908
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:45,766
oh there's some money

909
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:50,733
what do we got here

910
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:57,500
all right we've got some good information from them

911
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,366
and see if Elizabeth has anything else

912
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:05,533
I have nothing to say to you why are you wasting your time

913
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:06,466
are you the Hardie girl

914
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:07,666
let's just hit her with a hard question

915
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:08,450
I am not

916
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,766
you could be Liz

917
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,200
you could be anything

918
00:49:11,466 --> 00:49:12,966
you could even be a model

919
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,355
even a mod 

920
00:49:14,795 --> 00:49:17,500
Glen I went to law school

921
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:18,975
I am an attorney

922
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:21,366
he's right with a face like that

923
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:24,333
she could be on the cover of la debutant international

924
00:49:25,866 --> 00:49:27,566
get a grip Glen she went to law school yeah

925
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:29,500
let's let's divide and conquer

926
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,472
so fucking what 

927
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,946
 lots of models are actually really smart people fuckwad

928
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:36,193
I hate being insulted like that

929
00:49:36,193 --> 00:49:38,332
no Glen they aren't

930
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,666
ah fuck okay

931
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:43,566
don't insult me I am very fragile

932
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,133
Lena get in there and show them

933
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,100
show them what it means to be a good human

934
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,600
okay

935
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,227
let's talk to this guy what is he got for us

936
00:49:59,525 --> 00:50:01,700
got any insights he's seen anything around

937
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,350
it's all about money you know

938
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,000
this guy this is the who benefits guy

939
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,800
right here

940
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,333
that's he's just sitting around all day

941
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,866
and that's what he's thinking he goes he

942
00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:16,600
what's his story

943
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,166
let's say psychoanalyze him

944
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:18,966
what's he got

945
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,666
money is what really matters

946
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,866
they say money can't buy you happiness

947
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:26,900
but that just means you don't have enough money

948
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,225
you have to invest your money wisely

949
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:31,200
you can buy stocks with money

950
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,023
and then use those stocks to make even more money 

951
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:36,733
that way you'll have enough money 

952
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,676
when you grow old to make new money

953
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:42,300
real estateis the grave yard where tired old money goes to rest

954
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,800
money is what literally makes the world turn

955
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:47,466
the laws of money are just the laws of nature

956
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:50,266
unpaid labor doesn't net you any money

957
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,400
there's no

958
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,767
how many fucking lines of dialogue does this guy have

959
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:56,933
money is all about numbers

960
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:58,900
money is actually all about trust

961
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,700
it's all about money you know

962
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,133
wow

963
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:10,785
I I am shocked at how many like just 

964
00:51:10,785 --> 00:51:14,225
ambient dialogue choices this guy has

965
00:51:14,225 --> 00:51:14,766
okay

966
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,466
it's all about money is it

967
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:26,366
then what has led you sir to sitting around drinking all day

968
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:28,133
where's the profit motive in that

969
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,600
I think your system is flawed

970
00:51:35,933 --> 00:51:39,733
okay let me let me try this out he's a capitalist right

971
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,333
that's the money politics

972
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:49,300
I don't know let's go see what Cuno's up to

973
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,191
I can go tell Garte that I understand money now that's true  

974
00:51:54,371 --> 00:51:57,266
I just have to hit him with it's all about money friend

975
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:03,466
have you come to make your offering to Cuno

976
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:06,300
okay look

977
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,452
I do want to make up to Cuno 

978
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:09,375
but I can't really give him cigarettes

979
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:10,566
I think that would be

980
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,066
well it would be amusing

981
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:23,725
our character is starting to develop a better moral path to solving problems 

982
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,900
I'll come back when I have something substantial for you Cuno

983
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,333
I have not forgot about you

984
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,366
let's take another look at those footprints

985
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,600
what do you see

986
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,300
no we've been through all that okay

987
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,500
um so I don't have my badge I can't talk to Joyce

988
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,200
I guess I could ask around about the tattoos

989
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:56,900
the watermarks I don't know let's what I should do is actually

990
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,300
look at my ledger right

991
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,600
I had something in here that I didn't have yeah

992
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,333
can I do something with this

993
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,700
let's try this again

994
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
it's the ledger you found in the trash

995
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,166
a cabbage of papers hanging from the board

996
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,666
with the permeables' drawer inside

997
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,133
it's barely held together by a clip

998
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,066
then made complete by the faint smell of urinal cleaner

999
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,966
okay so

1000
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:32,133
my odds aren't great

1001
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,666
I can always try though

1002
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:42,700
let's try to read the case files first

1003
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,766
yes at last

1004
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,600
you find a way to piece them together

1005
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,466
using the alphanumeric code on the margin

1006
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:58,666
HDB41 date of initialization and time of arrival on the scene

1007
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:01,866
followed by the title for example

1008
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:11,700
HDB41120117:00 the next world mural

1009
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,115
weren't those officer precinct

1010
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:18,200
 why yes

1011
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,933
your precinct number is 41

1012
00:54:21,066 --> 00:54:21,600
and HDB

1013
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,548
every last alpha numeric in the files begins with it

1014
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,733
and these are your case files

1015
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:33,100
it's safe to say H.D.B are your initials

1016
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:34,450
Harry Du Bois 

1017
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,606
Harry Du Bois

1018
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:36,718
 H.D.B.

1019
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:41,025
still feels like there's something missing from that

1020
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:46,333
I think what you meant to say was RAC Rafael Ambrosius Costeau

1021
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:50,507
yes I'm ready to give up on Rafael 

1022
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:52,366
he was a necessary

1023
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:56,400
facade

1024
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,900
but I'm ready to move on from him

1025
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:02,950
that's comforting to hear

1026
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:03,900
now detective

1027
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,966
it takes half an hour to piece one of these together

1028
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,591
if you still want to

1029
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,733
 here are your options

1030
00:55:10,733 --> 00:55:13,200
I want to okay the next world mural let's go

1031
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,940
this one is relatively easy to reconstruct

1032
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,166
overnight on 1202

1033
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,122
a graffito nay a mural

1034
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:25,500
appears on an eight story tenement overlooking central jamrock

1035
00:55:25,533 --> 00:55:28,475
the building is a sparsely inhabited ghost tower

1036
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:32,966
part of a failed real estate development called Grand Couron

1037
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,475
the mural is enormous

1038
00:55:35,475 --> 00:55:39,300
two silhouettes a man and a woman are kissing

1039
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,075
 the text cut into their form reads

1040
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,286
TRUE LOVE IS POSSIBLE

1041
00:55:44,286 --> 00:55:46,475
ONLY IN THE NEXT WORLD

1042
00:55:46,475 --> 00:55:47,600
FOR NEW PEOPLE

1043
00:55:47,933 --> 00:55:49,230
IT IS TOO LATE FOR US

1044
00:55:49,535 --> 00:55:51,733
 WREAK HAVOC ON THE MIDDLE CLASS

1045
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:56,650
true love is possible only in the next world

1046
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,300
for new people

1047
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,510
it's too late for us

1048
00:55:58,848 --> 00:56:00,966
 wreak havoc on the middle class

1049
00:56:02,466 --> 00:56:04,166
not sure how those two ideas are really

1050
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,700
connected this could take up my whole day

1051
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:14,650
people call it that thing and that fucking thing

1052
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,750
it's visible for miles

1053
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,700
in two days

1054
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,666
the station's complaint's desk gets clogged with requests to remove the bummer

1055
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,600
you and your partner are assigned to the case

1056
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,400
the graffito crew is easy to track down

1057
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,200
only the Belles Lettres

1058
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,566
have the literage of industrial paint to cover the surface

1059
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:36,700
one of the graffito artists is rumored to be rich

1060
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,400
they take responsibility for the execution

1061
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:40,933
but not the design

1062
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,150
the idealogue of the next world miral

1063
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,725
as the crew calls it

1064
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:47,666
remains an unknown

1065
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,825
do I ever find out who came up with it

1066
00:56:49,825 --> 00:56:53,300
the case files do not show you finding the author of the design

1067
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:54,450
okay

1068
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:57,625
the crew agrees to clean up after themselves

1069
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:01,425
however your partner JV is against the removal

1070
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:03,800
citing public support for conservation

1071
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:07,100
this leads to a debate in precinct 41

1072
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:09,826
which then spreads to the streets of Jamrock

1073
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,175
ending in a rare plebiscite

1074
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:15,385
organized by you and the rest of Row III

1075
00:57:15,859 --> 00:57:19,300
the nine thousand people subjected to the murals message

1076
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:22,836
all of Lakeside Central Jamrock and Villalobos

1077
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,200
plus half of the Eminent Domain participate in the vote

1078
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:29,100
although the case begins with

1079
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,700
what appears to be a lot of rambling on the streets

1080
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,800
as to how juvenile and stupid the mural is

1081
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,333
given a choice between two options

1082
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:43,066
so I'm to decide basically what happened or

1083
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:46,100
am I guessing what I did

1084
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:52,766
I mean I'm okay with the

1085
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:58,500
true love is possible part that's kind of poetic

1086
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,700
but I'm not sure about

1087
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,967
the whole wreak havoc on the middle class thing

1088
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:04,100
what I did

1089
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:07,225
remove the mural it's wrong

1090
00:58:07,225 --> 00:58:08,622
keep the mural it is right

1091
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:11,933
I mean I probably go with what feels right

1092
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:15,066
I would probably remove it just because it's controversial

1093
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,698
someone's gonna be mad about that

1094
00:58:18,698 --> 00:58:22,725
a staggering 78 percent of voters choose to keep it

1095
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:25,966
turns out the opposition were allowed minority

1096
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:29,300
and that love truly is possible in the next world

1097
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,566
for new people

1098
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,769
and it is too late for us

1099
00:58:33,325 --> 00:58:34,875
I don't know I guess 

1100
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,500
all that remains is to wreak havoc on the middle class

1101
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,333
someone is going to I don't know if someone's gonna like

1102
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:47,400
don't read into the choices I'm making here

1103
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,166
I have fucking no idea what this is about to be honest

1104
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:51,366
I'm just gonna choose something

1105
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,966
I must have voted and possibly even lobby to remove the thing

1106
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,800
because I don't believe in that rubbish one bit

1107
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,533
it's human nature

1108
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,400
I mean I think that this is accurate right

1109
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:11,800
the middle class are not to be blamed it's human nature

1110
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,066
like that's a pretty centrist thing to say like that

1111
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:17,166
this is not a politically motivated thing

1112
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:21,100
they really read into me

1113
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,091
look I have no fucking clue what I'm 

1114
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:26,933
I gonna make a choice here

1115
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,225
I have no idea what deeper thing it implies

1116
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:30,266
I just don't

1117
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:32,466
have

1118
00:59:35,766 --> 00:59:38,000
if this were like a psychological question

1119
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,285
I would have more depth to say about it 

1120
00:59:42,285 --> 00:59:43,866
yeah I'm just gonna go centrist 

1121
00:59:47,066 --> 00:59:47,825
it's human nature

1122
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:49,500
did anyone ask you what you believe in

1123
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,333
man with the smelly toilet ledger

1124
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,166
what do you want to tackle next

1125
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,166
or are we done

1126
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,566
I can revisit this

1127
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,700
stream like

1128
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:11,725
good man doing nothing

1129
01:00:11,725 --> 01:00:14,100
not much has changed in the meanwhile

1130
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:17,866
a bunch of sudden papers still sags from the clipboard

1131
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,733
it's pretty in character as well

1132
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:26,500
like what is my attachment to these things

1133
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,166
I mean my memory is gone

1134
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:31,666
I don't know if the person I am right now

1135
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,466
would make the same decisions

1136
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,300
that prior Harry would have done

1137
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,433
let's see if we can open that compartment

1138
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,266
just relax

1139
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,675
the two sides of the board are slightly misaligned

1140
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:46,866
like a draw that's come off the slides

1141
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:51,725
all you need to do is bend the plastic on your knee slowly

1142
01:00:51,725 --> 01:00:52,100
okay

1143
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,800
the slides snap back into place

1144
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:58,066
it should be possible to just you know

1145
01:00:58,866 --> 01:00:59,975
slide the drawer open

1146
01:00:59,975 --> 01:01:01,766
without resistance or sound

1147
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,333
the two panels move against each other

1148
01:01:04,466 --> 01:01:06,725
the compartment is now open

1149
01:01:06,725 --> 01:01:07,733
what's inside

1150
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:10,666
two ticket stubs and a handmade postcard

1151
01:01:11,429 --> 01:01:12,229
okay

1152
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:14,629
what

1153
01:01:16,766 --> 01:01:17,733
pick up the ticket stubs

1154
01:01:17,733 --> 01:01:21,800
two octopuses are smiling reaching their tentacles toward each other

1155
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,866
in the colored pencil drawings

1156
01:01:23,966 --> 01:01:27,500
the tickets permit access to the zoo in Revachol East

1157
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,500
the aquarium costs extra

1158
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,466
these let you go there too

1159
01:01:33,766 --> 01:01:34,566
OK

1160
01:01:37,933 --> 01:01:38,425
pick up the card

1161
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:42,075
thin wax paper has been glued to a piece of cardboard

1162
01:01:42,075 --> 01:01:44,600
sounds like leaves rustling when you pick it up

1163
01:01:44,933 --> 01:01:46,600
you see violet flowers

1164
01:01:46,766 --> 01:01:48,266
floral patterns

1165
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:49,344
patches of glue

1166
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,773
it smells of chewing gum

1167
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,675
apricot flavored

1168
01:01:53,675 --> 01:01:55,333
a touch of cinnamon

1169
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:56,875
the end of summer

1170
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,766
you think the label says TuttI Frutti

1171
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:00,725
let's open it

1172
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:03,411
familiar handwriting lines the inside of the card

1173
01:02:03,827 --> 01:02:07,266
 looped round letters in a woman's hand 

1174
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,800
yes this is what I wanted I wanted to know more

1175
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:15,766
about whatever relationship that we were in that

1176
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:25,654
this is a clear point of major tension in our character's past right 

1177
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:26,833
 like I've been saying for a while

1178
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:29,066
that there has to have been probably something

1179
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,233
something that made us very upset with

1180
01:02:37,266 --> 01:02:39,900
I don't know the direction of our life was taking and

1181
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,600
that's not to say that the relationship was everything

1182
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,966
but a breakup

1183
01:02:46,366 --> 01:02:50,249
or some sort of disruption in a major relationship

1184
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:56,107
 is often a catalyst for many other things going wrong 

1185
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:57,666
 that were already going wrong

1186
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:59,666
but that you were withstanding right

1187
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,866
like if I have a shitty job

1188
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:07,799
and I don't like the location I live in

1189
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:12,500
but I am really you know happy in my relationship

1190
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,166
like there's a lot of stuff I can withstand between those things 

1191
01:03:20,466 --> 01:03:21,466
but

1192
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,433
suddenly something starts happening in my relationship

1193
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:26,466
it's going to like

1194
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:29,100
excuse me it's going to make me

1195
01:03:31,066 --> 01:03:34,400
reevaluate how much I'm really able to put up with those other things 

1196
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,500
and I feel like that's probably what happened to us

1197
01:03:38,633 --> 01:03:40,066
lots of stuff was already going wrong

1198
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,300
but the relationship

1199
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:45,896
really is what kind of set it all off 

1200
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:51,215
yeah I am having some sort of issue with the chat  

1201
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:54,600
 not only is it not appearing on this green

1202
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,466
but I am also like it's like not refreshing from me either

1203
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,366
something that led us to amnesia inducing heavy drinking yeah

1204
01:04:06,266 --> 01:04:06,769
let's continue

1205
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:07,428
Harry 

1206
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:09,909
it begins you're already reading

1207
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:13,700
I wanted to write you a letter  so you can read it when you wake up 

1208
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:15,834
maybe it will make you happy

1209
01:04:16,177 --> 01:04:18,224
oh shit we actually have something from

1210
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,003
from her

1211
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:25,166
 throw it away please

1212
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:30,376
we're gonna keep reading

1213
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:34,300
 your hand shakes holding the card

1214
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:38,466
every morning when I step out and you're asleep behind me

1215
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:39,054
it says

1216
01:04:39,494 --> 01:04:42,400
I find a little piece of sadness in me

1217
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:46,433
I carry it in my chest down voyager road

1218
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,491
every step I take it grows

1219
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:51,866
 by the time I reach the fuel station

1220
01:04:51,866 --> 01:04:53,866
it has filled me entirely

1221
01:04:54,238 --> 01:04:56,364
I step onto the light rail and look back

1222
01:04:56,773 --> 01:04:59,166
 sparks fall from the bow collector 

1223
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:02,233
I know it will be like this until late afternoon

1224
01:05:02,373 --> 01:05:06,173
when I get off the forty two and walk back to you

1225
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:07,516
keep reading

1226
01:05:07,516 --> 01:05:11,466
 you you every step I take will get lighter

1227
01:05:11,466 --> 01:05:15,248
it almost makes me run sometimes I do 

1228
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,166
I can't believe I met you

1229
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,166
I can't believe the happiness I feel with you

1230
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,800
you have a vast vast soul

1231
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:27,218
and I will always always always come back to it

1232
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:29,714
 kisses kisses kisses 

1233
01:05:29,714 --> 01:05:32,400
 you feel the air sucked up your lungs 

1234
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,490
and the blood sucked up your head

1235
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,815
 everything around you gets dark 

1236
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,778
small white dots appear 

1237
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,601
 you feel the ledger slip from your hand

1238
01:05:42,848 --> 01:05:45,300
 no no hold on

1239
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,239
we're gonna hold on

1240
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:50,415
 to what there's nothing

1241
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,400
detective is everything all right 

1242
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,233
no Kim nothing is all right

1243
01:06:07,433 --> 01:06:08,900
what just happened did I die

1244
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,200
what

1245
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:30,700
there is nothing again

1246
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:33,888
nothing nothing

1247
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:35,466
nothing sad brother

1248
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:37,883
no treachery just blackout

1249
01:06:37,883 --> 01:06:38,883
just lie there

1250
01:06:38,883 --> 01:06:43,854
well almost nothing there is the ground below you that's still there 

1251
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:50,113
 and the small light that's on fluttering somewhere in the basal ganglia 

1252
01:06:50,113 --> 01:06:50,735
 who is that

1253
01:06:50,735 --> 01:06:53,233
that's me blue eyes that's me

1254
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:55,632
and who was that

1255
01:06:55,632 --> 01:06:56,666
 who is what

1256
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:02,000
he speaks of the sickening longing the unwell emotion

1257
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,600
even in the darkness he's grasping for it

1258
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:11,400
still trying to hold on to the great sorrow slip in the water

1259
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,352
slimy

1260
01:07:14,632 --> 01:07:15,959
 no I was cool I'm cool

1261
01:07:15,959 --> 01:07:20,153
the cool when you're dead brother

1262
01:07:20,502 --> 01:07:24,391
here in the palco-mammalian cortex we call it 

1263
01:07:24,657 --> 01:07:26,646
the shadow

1264
01:07:26,935 --> 01:07:29,166
because it's always there

1265
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,562
was that the ex-something

1266
01:07:35,562 --> 01:07:39,024
bloated corpse of the past resurfacing

1267
01:07:39,303 --> 01:07:42,052
 no it was beautiful

1268
01:07:42,623 --> 01:07:44,151
 beautiful 

1269
01:07:45,015 --> 01:07:47,212
believe me stupid ape

1270
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:51,095
its lack of beauty was not the problem

1271
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:53,066
 where is voyager road

1272
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:55,097
there is no voyager road

1273
01:07:55,248 --> 01:08:02,400
 there are no roads no houses no lights in the windows it's all on pause 

1274
01:08:03,898 --> 01:08:05,833
my name appears to be Harry

1275
01:08:06,448 --> 01:08:08,162
 your name is fuck all

1276
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,339
it certainly ain't Harry

1277
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:12,666
then what is it

1278
01:08:13,768 --> 01:08:15,666
your name is passed out on the ground

1279
01:08:15,978 --> 01:08:18,800
dragged around by one of the other evil apes

1280
01:08:18,978 --> 01:08:20,936
they're taking you somewhere

1281
01:08:21,485 --> 01:08:22,549
 just motionless

1282
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:24,566
you think they would let you

1283
01:08:25,223 --> 01:08:29,000
until you disintegrate into biomolecules

1284
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:33,100
no someone is breathing on your face now

1285
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,031
inspecting your pupil stupid idiot

1286
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:37,500
 what is that it's cold

1287
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,666
they're pouring something on you it's in you

1288
01:08:43,137 --> 01:08:44,230
and it's

1289
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:46,161
it's delicious

1290
01:08:46,683 --> 01:08:50,893
glowing lights on a dashboard emerge out of nothingness 

1291
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:53,414
oh shit where am I

1292
01:08:53,414 --> 01:08:57,207
in the upholstered cabin of Lieutenant KitsuragI's motor carriage

1293
01:08:57,207 --> 01:08:59,501
seated in the driver's basket

1294
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:03,800
the air is thick with leatherworks and heavy fuel oil

1295
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,900
cold water runs down your chin

1296
01:09:08,749 --> 01:09:11,952
volition tried to protect you from this but you needed to know that's true 

1297
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:13,800
drink water

1298
01:09:14,406 --> 01:09:16,766
ugh Kim saved my life

1299
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:18,800
he saved my fucking life

1300
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:23,340
the water is cold silvery

1301
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:27,743
the stuff of life itself as it pours down your parched throat 

1302
01:09:27,743 --> 01:09:31,808
the pounding in your head recedes the darkness parts

1303
01:09:31,808 --> 01:09:32,800
 drink 

1304
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:35,285
you haven't drunk water in two days

1305
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:39,200
did you know the human body is not made to survive an alcohol alone

1306
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,788
you need a secondary form of hydration

1307
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:45,874
well I suspected something like that was true Kim

1308
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:49,633
with greedy gulps you down half a liter of cold water

1309
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:52,633
some of it spills on the driver's seat

1310
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,268
the lieutenant pays no heed to it

1311
01:09:55,268 --> 01:09:56,366
what happened

1312
01:10:00,566 --> 01:10:03,763
I came in contact with the burnt out ruins of the past 

1313
01:10:03,763 --> 01:10:05,366
god it's beautifully written

1314
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,038
I should ask you the same

1315
01:10:13,038 --> 01:10:16,166
 you were reading your paperwork then you passed out 

1316
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:19,266
I carried you to my Kinema to take you to a hospital

1317
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:20,702
then you came to

1318
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:22,827
how long was I out

1319
01:10:24,466 --> 01:10:25,800
I was dehydrated

1320
01:10:25,866 --> 01:10:29,017
I fuck it start climbing out the motor car

1321
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:32,400
I have I’m starting

1322
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,476
I'm starting to feel that I can trust 

1323
01:10:34,476 --> 01:10:37,300
Kim to understand what I am going through

1324
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,566
and maybe that it explains some of my behaviors

1325
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,048
let's tell him that we burnt out

1326
01:10:43,048 --> 01:10:44,633
that does sometimes happen

1327
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:47,371
you dropped this

1328
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:49,356
are you okay to proceed

1329
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:52,104
let's solve this case

1330
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:53,407
good

1331
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:57,049
the Ledger of failure in Hatred is a special item 

1332
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:59,566
that can be used both as an INTERACTABLE

1333
01:10:59,566 --> 01:11:03,100
and a TOOL equipped in your HELD slot for skill bonuses

1334
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:06,507
find it under the TOOLS tab in your INVENTORY

1335
01:11:06,507 --> 01:11:07,366
 okay

1336
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:13,466
okay there is something that I have been wanting to do

1337
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:19,966
and I think

1338
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:28,262
this moment has given me some context  that I was hoping to find  

1339
01:11:28,262 --> 01:11:29,900
first before I did this

1340
01:11:32,442 --> 01:11:34,445
let's check out the new thought that I got

1341
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:36,600
white mourning

1342
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,900
you see yourself from above

1343
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,400
you've passed out on the blue tiles of the hostel room floor

1344
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:46,833
even from this distance you can see your eyelids flutter

1345
01:11:47,056 --> 01:11:48,055
at the mention of what

1346
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:50,700
a great white object letting out its sweet smell

1347
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,100
like a Lily of the valley

1348
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:54,266
the little man's forgotten its name

1349
01:11:54,266 --> 01:11:55,833
but he still remembers the feeling

1350
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:59,000
and look he moves the feeling animates him

1351
01:11:59,033 --> 01:12:01,900
he instinctively reaches out for the feeling's best friend

1352
01:12:02,266 --> 01:12:03,924
a bottle of Commodore Red

1353
01:12:04,306 --> 01:12:07,666
he puts on his disco clothes and gets smaller and smaller 

1354
01:12:10,515 --> 01:12:11,315
okay

1355
01:12:14,366 --> 01:12:16,833
what I appreciate about this game is that it tends to

1356
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:21,366
it gives you stuff like this

1357
01:12:21,366 --> 01:12:24,166
that's like I understand it viscerally

1358
01:12:24,392 --> 01:12:27,100
like I know what the emotional context I'm getting in 

1359
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,166
but I have no realistic context

1360
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:33,966
which is actually very psychological right like

1361
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:39,166
people either get one or the other

1362
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:40,829
usually like someone is able to give me

1363
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:43,400
 a very quick history of what happened to them 

1364
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,700
and they can say yeah I got in a car accident and I got hurt 

1365
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,866
and I was scared and whatever else

1366
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:53,800
but they may be missing the visceral or emotional part of that

1367
01:12:56,033 --> 01:13:00,374
sometimes people are so shocked emotionally

1368
01:13:00,374 --> 01:13:02,266
 that they have a hard time like 

1369
01:13:04,022 --> 01:13:06,100
with the other side of it right like

1370
01:13:09,035 --> 01:13:10,800
not so much what happened to them

1371
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,433
but pulling together all of the different pieces of what happened to them 

1372
01:13:14,966 --> 01:13:15,566
for example

1373
01:13:15,566 --> 01:13:18,900
Harry is not able to piece together why he was an alcoholic

1374
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,800
why he feels so depressed

1375
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,566
why he sees the world in terms of power dynamics

1376
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:29,085
why he is so afraid of being seen constantly as pathetic 

1377
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:30,383
like these are not

1378
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,660
these are things I can't tangibly point to and say in reality that's why 

1379
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,650
and that's what we're discovering

1380
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:39,066
 through the Ledger through all these different things 

1381
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,400
we're starting to get some of that context

1382
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:43,900
right

1383
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:47,532
a lot of this speaks to like universal language that 

1384
01:13:47,532 --> 01:13:50,500
we all have about emotions

1385
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:54,500
but we're missing the context of our life right

1386
01:13:55,963 --> 01:13:58,035
so there's something I wanna to do

1387
01:13:58,425 --> 01:13:59,948
on my

1388
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:02,066
my white board here

1389
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:04,600
I'm bringing out the Brady Board okay

1390
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:12,758
for those of you who are long time viewers of the channel 

1391
01:14:12,758 --> 01:14:17,200
you will recognize this thing that I have in front of me

1392
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:26,300
so this is called a Johari window 

1393
01:14:28,266 --> 01:14:31,300
it's called Johari because the guys who invented it were named

1394
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,966
Joseph and Harrington

1395
01:14:38,116 --> 01:14:39,000
it's a cool name

1396
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,577
it's a pretty cool sounding name I have to admit 

1397
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,794
so the johari window is something

1398
01:14:43,794 --> 01:14:47,333
that I do use in therapy with people

1399
01:14:50,883 --> 01:14:53,850
for specific things okay

1400
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:59,325
I used the johari window for specific things

1401
01:14:59,325 --> 01:14:59,933
like

1402
01:15:01,066 --> 01:15:08,533
when we are doing some of the identity deconstruction reconstruction process 

1403
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:13,500
when we're trying to learn more about themes and patterns in someone's life 

1404
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,841
we might use this

1405
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:19,725
framework

1406
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,114
to explore some of that

1407
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:24,425
so it's pretty simple how it works right

1408
01:15:24,425 --> 01:15:26,491
this is about understanding

1409
01:15:27,391 --> 01:15:30,000
how we represent ourselves to the world

1410
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,533
where we are right now

1411
01:15:31,533 --> 01:15:35,366
so there are things that are known to other people

1412
01:15:35,366 --> 01:15:37,125
and that we know about ourselves

1413
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:40,333
for example like certain parts of our personality right 

1414
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:44,800
um we're gonna get into everything that belongs here for Harry

1415
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,666
but for example

1416
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,300
like he is a cop he knows that everyone else knows that right

1417
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:53,316
that's not like this is not an obscured fact about him

1418
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:55,566
so there are things that are known to us

1419
01:15:55,566 --> 01:15:57,298
and known to other people

1420
01:15:57,298 --> 01:15:59,766
there are things that are known to us

1421
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:02,566
that are not known to other people okay

1422
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:06,380
this is a lot of our emotional conflicts 

1423
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:09,000
this is secrets

1424
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,791
these are things that we are not super open about yet right

1425
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:18,733
then there are things that are known to other people

1426
01:16:18,733 --> 01:16:22,266
but are not known to ourselves right

1427
01:16:22,266 --> 01:16:23,750
this is a blind spot

1428
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:29,850
things that other people intuitively know or think about us 

1429
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:33,166
that we may not know yet ourselves

1430
01:16:33,366 --> 01:16:35,941
and sometimes it could be something you've heard before

1431
01:16:36,721 --> 01:16:40,966
like people say I'm a bad cop right

1432
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:42,800
you may be aware that people think that

1433
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,200
but it could still be in your blind spot

1434
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:49,266
because it's something known or concluded on by other people

1435
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:52,150
but it's not we haven't like internalized that yet

1436
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:52,900
or gossip

1437
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,666
it could be as well right

1438
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:55,428
it's a blind spot

1439
01:16:55,428 --> 01:16:56,938
and then there is the unknown

1440
01:16:56,938 --> 01:17:01,150
which are things that are not known to ourselves

1441
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,491
nor any one else right 

1442
01:17:05,008 --> 01:17:09,500
and we're going to use this metric to understand harry du bois

1443
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,467
as he exists right now

1444
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,940
because he's he's a very fascinating person to use this on right

1445
01:17:19,466 --> 01:17:23,763
specifically because he is someone with memory loss

1446
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:28,166
but also because we are on this path of self discovery 

1447
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:31,225
and we're not sure exactly how we feel about those things 

1448
01:17:31,225 --> 01:17:33,354
so like from the very beginning right

1449
01:17:33,354 --> 01:17:35,641
we can see that we are a cop

1450
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:41,100
but we're not sure like are we a good cop

1451
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:43,796
right

1452
01:17:43,796 --> 01:17:46,200
that something unknow to us

1453
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,300
and other people don't really know this either

1454
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,075
I mean I'm sure that there's some some opinions about it right  

1455
01:17:54,075 --> 01:17:54,891
but

1456
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:01,933
it doesn't seem like we've internalized that 

1457
01:18:01,933 --> 01:18:05,166
there is a conclusion made about this yet right

1458
01:18:05,725 --> 01:18:09,333
so some things that are known to us and known to other people are

1459
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:12,933
our I'll just put addictions right

1460
01:18:12,966 --> 01:18:18,366
we are clearly struggling with the substance use um

1461
01:18:20,683 --> 01:18:23,950
what is known to others is that we are

1462
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,375
let's say like

1463
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:30,433
struggling with

1464
01:18:31,533 --> 01:18:35,166
intelligence we're lacking intelligence

1465
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:38,491
that's something that we are also observing

1466
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:49,333
other things that other people know about us that we also know 

1467
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:53,400
is that like

1468
01:18:55,275 --> 01:18:57,466
we're struggling

1469
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,794
we're struggling emotionally

1470
01:19:02,794 --> 01:19:06,100
 we're struggling physically rights

1471
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,466
we're struggling with all kinds of stuff

1472
01:19:12,066 --> 01:19:17,066
so these are some of the things that people do know about us

1473
01:19:17,066 --> 01:19:18,466
and we'll keep building that

1474
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:21,900
but I want to put something in each category first right

1475
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:28,900
so something that is not known to other people but known to ourselves right 

1476
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:33,900
is like our sense of shame

1477
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,600
the reason I'm putting this here and not known to others

1478
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,025
even though we have definitely made some shameful actions 

1479
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,333
is like

1480
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:47,300
we're trying everything we can to protect this from moving up here 

1481
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:51,366
and that's kind of more so about what goes in these categories

1482
01:19:51,366 --> 01:19:56,848
is we use this to understand where things move as you make decisions and 

1483
01:19:56,848 --> 01:20:00,666
 asking the question okay well what does it mean to you 

1484
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,500
that having shame about this

1485
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,400
like people know you're a cop

1486
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,750
but you're not sure if you're a good cop

1487
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:11,966
you're not sure if you made good decisions before you blacked out 

1488
01:20:12,133 --> 01:20:15,066
you're not sure if you actually have the intuition to solve this case 

1489
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,500
those things give you shame

1490
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,400
and so what you do with that shame

1491
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,566
is you try to present yourself as an authority

1492
01:20:23,566 --> 01:20:26,000
you try to present yourself as intelligent

1493
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,933
and you are failing at those things

1494
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,800
we trying to use authority

1495
01:20:35,133 --> 01:20:38,484
and so the question we have about being a good cop 

1496
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,466
is leading to a sense of shame

1497
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:45,500
and to protect this from entering the arena

1498
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:50,466
which is where things are observable to everyone right

1499
01:20:51,158 --> 01:20:53,900
we're trying to act out this behavior

1500
01:20:55,166 --> 01:21:02,333
we try to use authority to minimize people's observation of this quality

1501
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:05,500
because we're afraid they'll discover that this is 

1502
01:21:05,925 --> 01:21:09,666
we're afraid that this will no longer be an unknown

1503
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:13,333
and it will become known to everyone that we are a bad cop right

1504
01:21:13,733 --> 01:21:17,439
so this is about understanding patterns of behavior and themes  

1505
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,866
more so than a lot of other things right

1506
01:21:20,866 --> 01:21:22,540
that's something that we can point to

1507
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,500
because like

1508
01:21:24,608 --> 01:21:27,166
my client may come in and say well

1509
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:31,375
I don't know why I keep getting into all these power struggles

1510
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:35,875
with Cuno and Elizabeth and Claire and Joyce and that sort of thing 

1511
01:21:37,316 --> 01:21:39,603
very simply we were able to discover 

1512
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,600
what the relationship between these things are 

1513
01:21:42,866 --> 01:21:45,900
and why there is a protectiveness over that right

1514
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:48,850
so we're trying to use authority

1515
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:51,500
there is definitely some shame that we have

1516
01:21:53,525 --> 01:21:55,900
there's a little bit of our past

1517
01:21:58,741 --> 01:22:02,300
that belongs kind of like in both of these right

1518
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:09,189
we were sort of starting to learn more about who we were

1519
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:11,366
let's do that

1520
01:22:13,075 --> 01:22:17,766
but we're not sharing it openly a lot right

1521
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:22,751
we're not discussing frequently

1522
01:22:22,751 --> 01:22:25,266
like what we just saw in the dream sequence

1523
01:22:25,266 --> 01:22:26,800
or what we saw on the Ledger

1524
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:32,066
we didn't immediately tell Kim what we thought about it right 

1525
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:35,391
and I think that we're not sure about ourselves

1526
01:22:37,066 --> 01:22:42,600
our view of self

1527
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:44,966
is kind of a mystery right

1528
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:46,166
it's something that we're not

1529
01:22:46,716 --> 01:22:49,100
we're not sure what we think about ourselves yet

1530
01:22:50,275 --> 01:22:53,366
all we know is that we definitely have some shame

1531
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:58,566
there is definitely some

1532
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,066
like I see it going this way where

1533
01:23:03,616 --> 01:23:07,100
because we have a questionable past

1534
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,350
and we have

1535
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:12,066
we're not sure what we think about ourselves as a cop 

1536
01:23:13,383 --> 01:23:16,733
we're already assuming that we regret a lot of what we did

1537
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:19,466
and we're bringing those regrets up here

1538
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,800
which is that we're sorry

1539
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:30,400
this has been a big part of reconciling the confusion about the past 

1540
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:36,300
is that we don't even know exactly what we did with all of our decisions 

1541
01:23:36,466 --> 01:23:41,575
and so what we're doing is trying to preemptively apologize

1542
01:23:42,525 --> 01:23:45,500
because we just assume that we have regrets about this

1543
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:46,916
our shame

1544
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:52,475
this shame is like driving this motion very strongly right

1545
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:54,950
and so we can actually identify shame

1546
01:23:54,950 --> 01:24:00,733
as one of the driving emotions of all of our behaviors right now 

1547
01:24:02,216 --> 01:24:04,087
because we can look at this and say

1548
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:07,900
yeah we're not totally sure about our past

1549
01:24:09,008 --> 01:24:13,533
we can see that the way people look at us about our addiction

1550
01:24:13,533 --> 01:24:15,000
about our lacking of intelligence

1551
01:24:15,755 --> 01:24:17,570
and even the way Lana talks to us

1552
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:20,500
that she's like so soft spoken

1553
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:22,333
and Kim is so like

1554
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,600
he's kind of like he lets us be on training wheels

1555
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,133
like we internalize that

1556
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:32,133
and we can see

1557
01:24:33,658 --> 01:24:36,166
that people are treating us a very different way

1558
01:24:36,841 --> 01:24:39,100
like they're almost they

1559
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:42,944
I think other people can see how fragile we are 

1560
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:46,058
in a way that we sort of can't right 

1561
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:58,933
we are not actually totally sure how fragile we are

1562
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:00,283
we are not sure

1563
01:25:01,591 --> 01:25:04,000
that if you pushed us in a certain direction

1564
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,100
we like what our limit is 

1565
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,566
and I think that that's something that other people can kind of see right 

1566
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,300
Lena is so soft spoken with us

1567
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,513
and Kim kind of puts training wheels on us

1568
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:19,380
because they sort of can tell

1569
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,459
what's going to happen if we start 

1570
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:26,300
getting too involved with our own feelings right 

1571
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,000
if we start looking more into this area

1572
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:31,300
and it's evident that

1573
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:35,219
what we just experienced

1574
01:25:35,543 --> 01:25:38,461
is learning a little bit more about this right

1575
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:41,227
our fragility sort of moved in this direction

1576
01:25:41,227 --> 01:25:44,427
because we looked at something in our past right

1577
01:25:45,275 --> 01:25:46,200
when we

1578
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:53,966
when we learn about the past 

1579
01:25:56,562 --> 01:26:00,514
our fragility sort of like becomes known to us 

1580
01:26:00,514 --> 01:26:01,496
and in this case

1581
01:26:01,496 --> 01:26:04,396
it became known to someone else as well right

1582
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:06,966
it became known to Kim

1583
01:26:08,546 --> 01:26:11,029
and we may find in future interactions

1584
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:12,766
that he he tells us like

1585
01:26:12,766 --> 01:26:14,750
maybe you shouldn't look into your past so much

1586
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,333
because it's harmful to you 

1587
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:18,525
and it could disrupt the case right

1588
01:26:18,525 --> 01:26:19,775
and so

1589
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:25,100
learning about our past what does this do to us

1590
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:30,051
what does it mean to discover that we are actually quite fragile

1591
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:35,067
it could lead to us

1592
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:38,133
trying to use more authority to sort of pump ourselves up

1593
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:40,842
and show other people that we are not so fragile

1594
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,583
what that would be doing is trying to

1595
01:26:47,138 --> 01:26:55,738
we're trying to make our past and this fragility become secretive 

1596
01:26:55,738 --> 01:26:58,871
we're trying to remove other people's ability to see this

1597
01:26:58,871 --> 01:27:04,871
because it lowers our chances of sort of convincing them that we're legit

1598
01:27:05,483 --> 01:27:08,966
so that's the kind of avoidance that I'm seeing

1599
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:12,966
when we're using the Johari window

1600
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,323
we might start looking at some of this

1601
01:27:14,323 --> 01:27:15,500
and say okay well

1602
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,733
you're scared of people discovering this

1603
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,800
you're scared of discovering it yourself

1604
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,303
and so what behaviors are you doing to force things down here

1605
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:27,275
when you see things moving a lot in this direction

1606
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:30,197
and concentrating in the facade 

1607
01:27:30,691 --> 01:27:32,625
you can call that avoidance

1608
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:34,933
pretty clearly right

1609
01:27:35,766 --> 01:27:38,500
we can call this like self defense

1610
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,100
we can call it trying to control the narrative about how people see you 

1611
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,708
that's a very common pattern right

1612
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:55,133
if we see things concentrating somewhere else though right

1613
01:27:56,422 --> 01:27:57,567
for example

1614
01:27:58,375 --> 01:28:01,766
before the story started

1615
01:28:02,275 --> 01:28:09,066
it is clear that a sense of shame and regret and fragility were known to us 

1616
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,466
these could have all been things that existed here

1617
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:16,666
and so drinking alcohol and you know pushing ourselves to the limit 

1618
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,975
could have been an attempt to move things here

1619
01:28:20,275 --> 01:28:22,283
to sort of erase ourselves

1620
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,366
and erase our view of ourselves

1621
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:27,600
because this is something that we are not happy about

1622
01:28:27,866 --> 01:28:31,800
and so when we are interested in reevaluating something

1623
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,400
like for example

1624
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:37,566
you know that we are struggling

1625
01:28:38,816 --> 01:28:41,800
sometimes we try to move it here right

1626
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,466
because we don't want to

1627
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:48,100
we want to deconstruct it right

1628
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,491
are we really struggling right

1629
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:51,166
we want to understand like

1630
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,166
is that something that we're really struggling with

1631
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,533
and we want to remove it from other people with perception right

1632
01:28:56,533 --> 01:28:59,366
so things can sometimes concentrate this way

1633
01:29:00,366 --> 01:29:02,466
they can sometimes concentrate that way

1634
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:07,360
what I see more about the rigorous self critique though  

1635
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,966
when I think about what that means thematically 

1636
01:29:12,966 --> 01:29:19,400
is like a lot of the motion that we're seeing is really more so like this right 

1637
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:26,466
we are invested in learning what's in our blind spot

1638
01:29:26,466 --> 01:29:28,533
what do people think about us

1639
01:29:30,716 --> 01:29:31,666
we are

1640
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,100
what

1641
01:29:38,408 --> 01:29:40,033
what manipulates us

1642
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:45,366
what are some of the desires that we have

1643
01:29:45,366 --> 01:29:46,975
that we may not even be aware of

1644
01:29:46,975 --> 01:29:49,966
that other people are aware of right

1645
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:54,142
someone in the chat asked where would you put desires

1646
01:29:54,142 --> 01:29:55,975
honestly I would probably say

1647
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:01,200
it's in the blind spot

1648
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,567
because we're not sure what we want yet right

1649
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:05,933
it's not like we know exactly

1650
01:30:06,266 --> 01:30:09,800
were not entirely sure if we want to engage with our past

1651
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,300
that's why we haven't looked in the mirror

1652
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:15,333
it's not totally unknown

1653
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:17,235
because other people can observe our behaviors

1654
01:30:17,235 --> 01:30:20,400
and see yeah well you you spent a lot of time looking for cigarettes 

1655
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,750
you spent a lot of time you know trying to get alcohol or whatever 

1656
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,766
and so desires feels to me

1657
01:30:28,766 --> 01:30:30,281
like it's here

1658
01:30:30,281 --> 01:30:33,843
and that's why manipulation works so well on us right

1659
01:30:33,843 --> 01:30:37,229
because it is it's our blind spot

1660
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:40,900
we don't even know what's really gonna trigger us right

1661
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:48,744
our face is definitely in the blind spot

1662
01:30:48,744 --> 01:30:49,903
definitely

1663
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:52,175
some amount of our identity

1664
01:30:59,995 --> 01:31:02,166
 sort of moving like that

1665
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:06,800
like it our identity is is becoming known to us

1666
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,933
but the more we learn about it

1667
01:31:10,516 --> 01:31:15,800
a lot of times we don't like things moving directly from blind spot over this way 

1668
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,800
because we haven't been able to decide privately what we feel about it 

1669
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:25,250
we are much more comfortable moving things like this way

1670
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,275
because it passes through

1671
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:34,500
let's remove people's awareness to that thing

1672
01:31:34,808 --> 01:31:36,300
decide how we feel about it

1673
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,150
and then maybe I'll show it to the world right

1674
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:45,366
but our identity is kind of like move in the reverse in my opinion right 

1675
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:49,733
it's becoming known to other people and ourselves at the same time 

1676
01:31:50,325 --> 01:31:53,766
we sort of reflect privately on what we think about it

1677
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:56,050
but then the more we learn

1678
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,666
like for example that

1679
01:31:58,941 --> 01:32:00,700
there's a relationship

1680
01:32:07,666 --> 01:32:11,641
one which we are very heartbroken about like

1681
01:32:13,358 --> 01:32:15,100
we suddenly learned about it

1682
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,402
but it's also unknown to us

1683
01:32:16,402 --> 01:32:18,400
like no one else really knows about this either 

1684
01:32:21,808 --> 01:32:24,966
but what I was saying was we have all these things right

1685
01:32:24,966 --> 01:32:27,500
and what I see a lot of

1686
01:32:29,466 --> 01:32:32,050
what I see happening a lot is

1687
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:37,966
things converging in the arena here right

1688
01:32:38,566 --> 01:32:40,200
it's called the arena because like this is

1689
01:32:41,206 --> 01:32:47,133
where your qualities receive the most critique challenge feedback right 

1690
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:54,066
its where things are observable to you and to other people 

1691
01:32:54,066 --> 01:32:57,566
and they are really put through their trials for like

1692
01:32:57,566 --> 01:33:01,900
how central they are to your identity right

1693
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:06,300
for example the whole thing with Kim

1694
01:33:06,466 --> 01:33:10,700
and my discovery of some of my unknown biases like

1695
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:17,400
they went like this right 

1696
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:22,700
like kim's cultural background was a blind spot to me

1697
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,089
like I had the wrong read on him

1698
01:33:25,464 --> 01:33:27,516
when I learned about that

1699
01:33:30,441 --> 01:33:36,566
I tapped into maybe what some of my unknown biases are right

1700
01:33:38,733 --> 01:33:41,666
and sort of brought them to the arena like

1701
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:44,500
I shared them with you all

1702
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,666
and that's what I see harry doing right

1703
01:33:48,733 --> 01:33:51,100
the more you make this motion

1704
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,866
and the more you try to bring things here

1705
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:56,325
the more invested you are in

1706
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,300
like facing your problems you know 

1707
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:05,066
and I see that in the way he is apologizing a lot right 

1708
01:34:05,066 --> 01:34:10,700
being a sorry cop to me is about alleviating this sense of shame

1709
01:34:12,341 --> 01:34:15,366
because we can't change this we can't change our past

1710
01:34:15,366 --> 01:34:16,666
we can't change what we did

1711
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,666
but we can try to change what it means to us right

1712
01:34:20,666 --> 01:34:23,667
and the more we learn about our past

1713
01:34:24,767 --> 01:34:30,250
the more we are able to apologize for what we did 

1714
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:35,005
the more we're able to apologize for what we did 

1715
01:34:35,005 --> 01:34:39,100
our identity does become more clear to us

1716
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:42,475
because we see it as a growth of moral character

1717
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:47,225
which slightly reduces the amount of shame that we have

1718
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:49,766
and makes us feel much more

1719
01:34:49,766 --> 01:34:52,366
like we are a good cop right

1720
01:34:52,366 --> 01:34:54,500
that's also coming up this way

1721
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,500
and what happens to our view of self when we apologize 

1722
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,333
and we see that feedback from other people right

1723
01:35:01,466 --> 01:35:04,350
it also improves somewhat

1724
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:08,400
I think to other people first and then to ourselves right 

1725
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:10,500
so I know this looks like a mess

1726
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,996
joharI window always does like 

1727
01:35:14,271 --> 01:35:16,600
because we're looking at patterns

1728
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,100
we're looking at behaviors

1729
01:35:18,266 --> 01:35:20,175
and we're trying to understand like

1730
01:35:20,725 --> 01:35:24,166
okay if this is the machine that's driving a lot of this 

1731
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,341
we need to understand why this is so important to you

1732
01:35:29,533 --> 01:35:32,600
and that doing this right here

1733
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,886
trying to use authority to protect people from

1734
01:35:34,886 --> 01:35:38,266
finding out that you're fragile or manipulatable

1735
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,900
is not reducing the shame

1736
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,466
it's actually making it worse

1737
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,225
what's actually reducing the shame is the apologies right  

1738
01:35:46,225 --> 01:35:49,600
and the positive feedback that you get from them

1739
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:57,000
so harry's development is very much like

1740
01:35:58,575 --> 01:36:00,700
this motion right here right

1741
01:36:01,425 --> 01:36:02,600
so it's interesting

1742
01:36:03,241 --> 01:36:06,800
this is something we'll return to the more we learn about him

1743
01:36:08,466 --> 01:36:12,144
because there's so much stuff here right about his past 

1744
01:36:12,144 --> 01:36:14,091
and there's so many things

1745
01:36:15,566 --> 01:36:18,133
we're probably not even aware or in our blind spot

1746
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:25,450
but yeah we're gonna keep this in view

1747
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:29,637
as we continue building out our view of mr harry

1748
01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:31,314
