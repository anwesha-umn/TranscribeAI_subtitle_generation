1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:01,133
hello

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,733
and welcome back to my therapist plays

3
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:05,733
Disco Elysium analysis series

4
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:06,933
so on today's episode

5
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,833
we are delving even deeper into the psychology of

6
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,166
our main character

7
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,000
as this case gets more complicated

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,166
so does our relationship with ourselves

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,866
because we're also going to start

10
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,266
discovering more about who we were and

11
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:25,466
finding that we are not so happy with that person

12
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,600
before we had amnesia

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,800
and woke up as the person we are today

14
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:30,766
and so what does it mean

15
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:32,500
to be faced with some of those challenges

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,700
do we avoid them and try to shut them out

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,100
or do we look for

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,566
healthy ways to integrate them and move forward

19
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:44,566
but we also do get into a major confrontation

20
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,100
we're going to face

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,166
what it is like when we go up

22
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,666
against an individual named Measurehead

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,866
who stands between us and

24
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,533
our next objective in solving the case

25
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,600
so all that is coming up in today's episode and

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,500
perhaps our first moments of

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
genuine trust starting to build between ourselves and our partner Kim 

28
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,700
I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you so

29
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:11,066
let's jump in

30
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,300
hey there's a big gentleman

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,233
bastards

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,900
we have a right to work

33
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,066
maybe this is the gentleman who

34
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,300
was asking about our case is a large lad

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:37,966
what's going on here

36
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,733
hold up and stay frosty everyone

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,700
cops are here

38
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,666
the broad shouldered alpha male turns to you

39
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,733
he's a full head taller than everybody else here

40
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,200
you here to fuck with us

41
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:52,333
beat the honest worker down

42
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,200
why should I

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,700
we're here to fight for a cause

44
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,333
stripes usually have problems with people who have causes

45
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,300
okay then I think I

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,433
I think no I want to be on your team friend

47
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:09,900
good

48
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,066
we're fighting for a cause here

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,366
right to work

50
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,800
right to work

51
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:17,933
besides

52
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,400
we're not that different

53
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,766
it helps if people see us talking

54
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,866
cops and strikebringers together

55
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,566
shows authorities around our side

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,800
builds confidence

57
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,366
I like his perspective I agree

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I agree with that

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,866
I think it's also kind of a power play that

60
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm like grinding the flashlight in everybody's face

61
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,600
because it makes them feel like I'm really targeting them

62
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,333
which is good for my interrogation

63
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,566
what kind of problems are we talking about

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,593
rights of workers to have gainful employment

65
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:53,766
 to make a salary

66
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:56,133
and feed their families

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,066
well I don't want to politically align with him

68
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,200
but I want to be on his team

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,733
because it looks like he could beat me up

70
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,300
so I don't want him to be angry at me

71
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,233
I don't think I've chosen any sides

72
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:08,866
any time

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,366
don't let the fat bastards tread on you

74
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,333
cops tend to sigh with the higher-ups

75
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,500
you're essentially still workers

76
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:21,200
I don't trust cops but I can see you understand though

77
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,733
right to work

78
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,533
right to work

79
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,800
let's just ask them some questions

80
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,866
hey Chris Wilderness

81
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,266
thank you so much for subbing my friend

82
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:34,133
enjoy your early access to things through the channel discord

83
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,133
you have to link your discord and

84
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,666
your Twitch account you'll be able to see all the

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,666
prior streams and stuff

86
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,133
maybe you should ask them

87
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,866
(maybe you should ask them) the questions like

88
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,533
why would not allow to make a living here

89
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,400
shame on you we have families to feed you piece of shit

90
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,000
so do we scab

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
found you from your YouTube channel

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,333
on your playthrough of this game

93
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,700
very excited to see more of your content

94
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,466
thank you

95
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:09,966
it's been a very interesting seeing all of this unfold

96
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,400
but we're having a great time

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,133
throwing some fucking tomatoes in the chat for our friends

98
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:20,900
tomato is like my my hype emote

99
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,533
you may not understand why but that's okay

100
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,766
just know that tomatoes are a good thing around here

101
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
they mean something good

102
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,366
I don't like them as fruits

103
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:34,166
but I love them as metaphorical devices

104
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,900
we flood the chat with tomatoes when we're happy

105
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,200
that's all you need to know

106
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,100
I actually need to speak with the union boss

107
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,600
that is true

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,300
have fun

109
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,266
union shits are on full strike

110
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,666
don't think they're going to let you through the gates

111
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,600
why you want to meet that fat asshole

112
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:56,566
this is an official matter

113
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,966
yeah I'm not gonna get this guy involved

114
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:03,600
he looks like he would use my information against me

115
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,300
right to work

116
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,800
it's shameful cops doing nothing

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,733
you should bring backup open up the gates for us

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,533
blockading gainful employment for workers is a crime

119
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,778
yeah the tomatoes are a Gundam reference

120
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:19,866
 witch for Mercury

121
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,200
this isn't really my area of expertise

122
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,866
we are not picking a side in this  just yet sir

123
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,933
finally Kim stands behind me for once

124
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,400
let us work

125
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,400
who are all these strikebreakers

126
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,800
(honest men and) women with rights to work to be useful

127
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,400
not toys for corporate interests

128
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,933
this guy is a he's a communist right

129
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,933
we came here to help the harbor

130
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,333
run smoothly in time of crisis

131
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,066
if Union fucks don't want work

132
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:00,000
they ought to let indulgs who do want work

133
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,400
I have a question

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,666
why do all these men follow your leadership

135
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,466
that's a good question Kim

136
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,800
no he's against the strike of the union

137
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,500
the other guy is a communist

138
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,100
let me take off the mask of if there even is one

139
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,533
that I know anything about politics

140
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,100
I do not it is not my area of safe commentary

141
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,333
I am a mental health professional

142
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't really have the vocabulary or the knowledge to

143
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,933
to give commentary on any of that shit

144
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,400
and I will just make myself look like a fucking idiot

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,933
if I do

146
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,471
so 

147
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,333
don't worry this game will teach you

148
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,166
I hope it does I don't like

149
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:47,500
it's just not my sector I spent my life studying people

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,266
and psychology

151
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,200
we're just informing you don't worry I know that's okay

152
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,766
mental health is political yes

153
00:06:56,766 --> 00:07:03,933
I can see the parallel but it doesn't come up in my work as often

154
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:10,247
this is the crossover that you will find 

155
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:14,166
in mental health and politics

156
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:21,366
is what we might call SDOH or social determinants of health

157
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,600
what I'm referring to are all of the

158
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,633
environmental political economic systems that

159
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:31,866
contribute to mental health

160
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,266
so you're correct

161
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,266
an economic system that

162
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,800
does not offer like equal opportunities to people

163
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:45,000
is going to lead to suppressed angers resentments

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,566
it can lead to racism

165
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,900
that sort of thing

166
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,466
like homelessness

167
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,500
obviously is a big impact on mental health as a social determinant

168
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,766
and it is influenced by political things

169
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,300
I understand that they are

170
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
that there is a thread connecting them but

171
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,500
my expertise is not in commenting on politics

172
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,333
it is understanding the mental health outcomes

173
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,566
that result from political systems

174
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,333
I don't even know really what I would say I'm

175
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,966
politically but it's

176
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,333
yeah I don't know

177
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,666
it's that it's not worth diving into to be honest

178
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,066
so I do know about politics

179
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:26,966
sort of

180
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:32,100
but not not to any sort of like depth about this like 

181
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,400
I know about them

182
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,000
mental health relation but not like by themselves

183
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:41,933
you think they follow because I'm big and loud

184
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,200
no they follow the rules of the market

185
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,100
the rules of the economy

186
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,500
because they were

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,133
given a job to do

188
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,266
yeah I guess what I would say is

189
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,600
I don't know how to spot what political system is which

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,333
what I do know is like

191
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:06,466
this is going to lead to lots of outgroup resentments

192
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:09,600
when workers feel underprivileged

193
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,966
and they haven't been fairly represented democratically

194
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,066
what is your goal here

195
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:20,266
we were promised work we'd be in there working

196
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:20,700
working

197
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,200
if the bastards hadn't shut the gates

198
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,466
and your are unable to breach the entrance

199
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,800
would take heavy ordinance to bust it open

200
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,933
could try to get in through the secretary's office

201
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,500
doors locked

202
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,800
the guards blocking the way to the access panel

203
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,500
I don't mean the scrawny Mesque punk either

204
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,933
I mean head measurer

205
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,300
or whatever he is

206
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,166
why don't you just talk to them that's a good idea

207
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,933
like civilized folk you mean

208
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:52,933
these native fucks don't understand civilized

209
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:56,100
it would be better for the neighborhood if you went home

210
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,866
at least for now if you can't get in anyway

211
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
it's a very neutral stance to take Kim I like it

212
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,300
no

213
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,666
they will give up eventually

214
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:10,300
or get drunk leave the button unguarded

215
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,800
then we charge

216
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,933
sounds like this guy needs a little bit of that boost

217
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,666
he gets from alcohol to his physical instrument

218
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:21,233
what is a strike

219
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,666
(when a) bunch of ungrateful

220
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,900
lazy cockroaches can't get their act together

221
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:29,366
decide to block honest work for other people

222
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
what do the strikers want

223
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,700
they mumble nonsense about board rooms and workers rights

224
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:41,666
while we have the right to work

225
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,766
when the man moves around

226
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:49,000
you perceive some serious abs underneath his tight fitting shirt

227
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,466
this man is in shape

228
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:52,698
yes he is

229
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:55,133
this seems odd in the way he carries himself

230
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,200
his sets of clothing looks vaguely mismatched

231
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,700
the different pieces of the attire seem ill fitting

232
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:03,100
what is that (mean)

233
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,500
it is far too small and an unpleasantly tight fit

234
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,966
while the overalls held up by a belt

235
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,133
seem to fit a man with much more corpulence

236
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,533
interesting

237
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,166
he ignores your question

238
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:20,100
choosing instead to turn to the emaciated workers

239
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,500
raising both fists in the air

240
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,666
the close are obviously not his

241
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,133
very interesting

242
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,533
if all the other workers are emaciated

243
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:33,300
why is he so buffed out

244
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,566
here's the thing guys

245
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,400
you gotta ask yourself who benefits

246
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,600
maybe he's a stooge

247
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:46,533
maybe he is actually on the wealthy union side

248
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,666
or is not really a part of these individuals

249
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,533
but he is very impressionable

250
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:51,566
and

251
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:56,966
able to assume the perspective of a leader archetype

252
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,900
which lots of people will crowd around and follow

253
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,500
and think that he has their best interests

254
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,133
when really he's the one saying well we can't storm in yet

255
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,300
he's actually a plant to stone wall

256
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,300
their initiative by pretending to be one of them

257
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:15,933
could be

258
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,566
who's to say who benefits

259
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,133
silence is the answer

260
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:21,300
there's something off air

261
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,266
but he won't say what

262
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,733
fucking rhetoric coming in now

263
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,733
you've been talking to him for quite a while man

264
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,333
something is off with the sky

265
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,400
asking where he's from

266
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,566
where are you from friend

267
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:34,566
what's it to you

268
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,866
routine part of the investigation

269
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:38,966
am I a suspect

270
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,766
done no crimes

271
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,733
I only fight for the rights people

272
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,766
I'm interested in your background

273
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,133
we're all workers right

274
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,700
workers stick together

275
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,400
came from the eminent domain jamrock backgrounds

276
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,466
and odd jobs heavy lifting cargo hauling bouncer work

277
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,000
I know the drill

278
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
a bouncer huh

279
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,366
where I frequent a lot of bars maybe it's one I know

280
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,733
worked at Territorial

281
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,333
ring a bell

282
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,600
never heard of it are you lying

283
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,133
we're done here

284
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,300
I have a strike to break

285
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,700
sus extremely sus

286
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,333
I don't like it

287
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:32,166
okay

288
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,933
we need to get up in there

289
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,025
scab

290
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,466
wait

291
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,400
what's happening

292
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:48,533
am I about to like

293
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,100
okay

294
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,966
I'm not a scab I'm a cop

295
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,600
ah I was just messing with you

296
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,700
no one's ever seen a cop scab

297
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,200
imagine you cops going on a strike

298
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,100
but then another cop comes in and says

299
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,133
let us cop for less money

300
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,766
speaking of what brings the RCM here to the Wild North

301
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:16,200
come to see the strive

302
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,333
I need to speak with your boss

303
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,866
I'm a bit short on money right now

304
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:20,966
can you give me some of it

305
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,066
actually I think we're pretty good on money right now

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,033
what's the strike about anyways let's find out more

307
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,466
(you know) serious business

308
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,733
I'm sure the big boss will be glad to tell you

309
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,333
you'll have to ask him first

310
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,733
okay I'll ask him first

311
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,366
wants to talk about the strike

312
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,000
return once you've met the union boss

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,133
and are on a better footing with the organization

314
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,733
finally suggestion coming in with some actually good insights

315
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,833
I mean I guess it can't hurt to ask him for money right

316
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,533
(sure thing) my friend

317
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,966
I can help you out

318
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,100
wait

319
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,500
why don't I just let it fall on the ground and then pick it up

320
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,066
right can't I

321
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,333
I don't want to embarrass myself again

322
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,766
I can't go through another embarrassment

323
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,066
I know let it fall in the ground

324
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,966
because it's lame well he think it's stupid

325
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,466
catch it

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,866
should I go for it we don't need worse morale I know

327
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:25,766
well look I

328
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,933
either I try to catch it and I embarrassed myself right

329
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,166
let it fall on the ground and I've seen his lame

330
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,600
what what am I supposed to do here okay this is the

331
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:39,866
hardest like conundrum to be put in

332
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,466
a cool cop would catch it

333
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,400
a cool cop would catch it

334
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,633
it would be so fucking lame to let it fall on the ground

335
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:50,366
and then pick it up

336
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,133
that's almost even more embarrassing

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,300
what would authority say authority would say

338
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,533
snatch that fucking coin purse out of this man's hands

339
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,900
this is the decision

340
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:07,133
I feel like everything kind of hinges on this

341
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,966
what if I drop a point into my hand eye coordination

342
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:15,100
I feel like I've been failing these over and over again

343
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,900
let's do it

344
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
yes

345
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,500
58 percent roll the dice baby

346
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,766
the coin narrowly slips by your outstretched fingers

347
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,366
and falls to the ground

348
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:30,866
fuck

349
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,400
God damn it

350
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,000
spending a point made it uncool

351
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:48,966
well look

352
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,700
all I'm trying to do is be the coolest cop around

353
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,166
no feeling like investing into a skill and then failing anyways

354
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,066
that's just my guys life

355
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,800
lost the point and dropped the coin

356
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,700
I know that's extremely lame

357
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,300
oh I'm sorry didn't mean to throw it like that

358
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,866
it's a thing we harbor folk do

359
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,300
passing around cargo and such

360
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,900
oh well he didn't he didn't actually

361
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,400
(was not meant) as provocation or ridicule

362
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:23,133
okay so he didn't he didn't scold me for it

363
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,066
but what does Kim think

364
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:26,666
the boiadeiro stares at you with respect

365
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:30,266
then gestures towards the trickles of blood

366
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,866
adorning your clothes

367
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:35,666
wait

368
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,466
wait

369
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:43,466
not catching the coin

370
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,666
just brought me and Kim closer together

371
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,700
I think yeah I think chat's right

372
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,466
there is probably a wrong voice line

373
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,133
but Kim just picked up the coin and handed it to me

374
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,066
that brings me closer to him

375
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,942
something about getting out of the labyrinth of

376
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:13,200
 words and dialogue

377
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,866
just by showing with his actions that

378
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:18,466
he will pick up where I fail

379
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:21,100
and not challenge or judge me for it

380
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,300
actually makes me feel a little more trusting of him

381
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,000
do I have a crush on Kim no

382
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,100
so far I have not been very trusting of Kim and

383
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,100
part of that is because I don't know

384
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:37,266
if he is earnest towards me

385
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,033
he says he has my back

386
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,800
but I don't know if I am just useful to him

387
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:44,666
but

388
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:47,700
so far he's been happy to just let me embarrass myself

389
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,666
and not really

390
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
well if not like directly feed into that embarrassment or

391
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,366
critique me in front of people

392
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,466
undermining me

393
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,966
but this time he just like

394
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,066
quietly picks up the coin and gives it to me

395
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,533
yeah this

396
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:06,866
maybe maybe for me

397
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,500
an action speaks louder than words sometimes

398
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
thank you Kim

399
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,066
right always glad to help out the RCM

400
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,966
we're on the same branch you and I

401
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,366
humans I mean not slithering scabs

402
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:21,966
okay I need to get moving here

403
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,366
good good what matters do you want to discuss with Evart

404
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,966
I'm not gonna disclose those details with you yet

405
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,600
so mysterious

406
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
I'll come back to you

407
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:37,600
either way the road in front of you is wide and open

408
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,800
does this mean you can let me (through the gate)

409
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,700
I don't operate in that capacity

410
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,566
I'm not a granter of passage

411
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,933
the passage grants itself

412
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:47,700
that's simple

413
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,933
walk right past Measurehead and go in

414
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,600
okay past Measurehead

415
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,900
yeah the two and a half meter tall Semenese supremacists there

416
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,900
walk right past him

417
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,066
okay

418
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,000
then press the button to unlock the door

419
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,733
okay

420
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:03,733
go past him again

421
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:04,500
okay

422
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,166
enter the arbor through the office

423
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:11,400
uh okay

424
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
I don't think that's gonna be that easy

425
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,766
(don't worry I'm sure it's not) completely impossible

426
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:17,309
for example you could best Measurehead 

427
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:19,000
in a physical confrontation

428
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:22,600
or you could convert to a Semenese supremacist world view

429
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,900
or

430
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,300
maybe it actually is completely impossible

431
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,666
well why are you misleading me

432
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,266
how do I get to where I want to go

433
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:39,066
I do have the physical instrument shirt on

434
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,666
are we extolling why

435
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,200
Kim Kitsuragi is the best damn cop in all of Revachol

436
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,100
and a damn good friend

437
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,166
well best cop I would say

438
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,366
I can agree with

439
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:50,766
best friend I'm I

440
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,000
it's a it's a I want to trust him

441
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,900
but I'm scared kind of thing with me and Kim right now

442
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,666
due to my character's

443
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,533
extreme trauma and abandonment issues presumably

444
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,733
that's just what I detect from him

445
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,133
it's making it hard for me to trust that he truly is

446
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,900
what he says to me

447
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,666
I want to believe it's true but

448
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,200
I still have my doubts

449
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,166
and yeah also he's been really fucking rude to me at

450
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,200
very important moments

451
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,133
not yet no

452
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,866
he's

453
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,100
incredibly strong

454
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,066
nothing a couple of solid hooks from Dexter and Sinister won't fix 

455
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,000
wait is that the name of my hands

456
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,300
Dexter and Sinister

457
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Jean-Luc himself would say the philosophy has proven

458
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,700
overly heroic for the scabs to convert to

459
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,000
sure

460
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:46,300
alright friend

461
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:52,133
there's got to be another way to get around this guy right

462
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:56,733
what do we got here

463
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,566
in case of a strike press button behind the guard

464
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,533
there's no lock picking or door kicking this one

465
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:12,333
we've got another cigarette friend here

466
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,066
can we talk to them no

467
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,500
okay we're finally at the harbor

468
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,800
let's see if we can

469
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,266
discuss our way through this conundrum

470
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,275
your body betrays your degeneracy

471
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,225
yeah Measurehead

472
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:32,766
his body totally betrays his degeneracy

473
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,675
don't say anything

474
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,400
 size him up first

475
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,325
yeah fucking let's go authority 

476
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,633
this is when I need you

477
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,633
this is when I need you to throw out your best dice rolls 

478
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:45,270
let's fucking size this guy up 

479
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,123
that's a power play

480
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:50,233
are you admiring my morphophysiology

481
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:54,318
a ripple of muscle passes underneath his skin

482
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:54,958
he lets you look

483
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,400
it must be frightening to stand in the shadow

484
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,817
of this *Racial Pinnacle*

485
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:04,812
be calm ham sandwich

486
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:07,590
 you are not in danger 

487
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,700
because you are not a threat to me

488
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,466
you know what friend I'm not a threat to you

489
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,233
let's keep him talking

490
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,600
let's just puff it out a little bit

491
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,200
what is this *androgynous* display of sexual maturity

492
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,500
merely standing up makes you swept profusely

493
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,933
your breathing is erratic

494
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:37,500
your own heart beating your ears grows frantic

495
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,466
and you feel your blood pressure rise

496
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,033
okay

497
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:41,866
stop it

498
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,233
you are embarrassing yourself in front of this woman

499
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,766
and your pedomophic friend

500
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,065
everything I do is embarrassing

501
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:52,865
khm...

502
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,700
my endurance is down by the cigs

503
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,833
no I trust that the cigarettes have had

504
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,500
no negative consequences on me

505
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,666
this display of weakness may appeal to older women

506
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,666
with a stronger maternal instinct

507
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:13,833
but it is a liability here on *Battlefield Martinaise*

508
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:15,301
okay 

509
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:15,950
Jean-Luc

510
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,700
his body is betraying his degeneracy pretty hard

511
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,766
maybe you can ask him to leave

512
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:25,066
how about I just go with the uh

513
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,166
well let's ask him to clarify that

514
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,666
you have succumbed to *Al Gul*

515
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:34,800
you reek of it

516
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:39,966
an invisible sword of *Al Gul* emerges from your throat

517
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:44,200
you cannot see it but others can

518
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:48,491
it is making the woman in my company sick

519
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:50,566
look I don't give a fuck about her

520
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:51,600
if she's there or not

521
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,990
has nothing to do with my investigation of here

522
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,765
 sir

523
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:56,800
you 

524
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,891
you think you think that just by

525
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:00,266
by

526
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,991
triggering my inferior masculinity that

527
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,566
that I'm gonna be afraid of you because

528
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,033
A: you're probably right

529
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:11,900
but B:

530
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,500
I just smoked a cigarette

531
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,400
my intellect is gonna help me out of this

532
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:19,525
let's just stand our ground

533
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:24,725
well maybe I can get him talking

534
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:26,900
 yes *Al Gul*

535
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:27,800
what is *Al Gul*

536
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,518
*Al Gul* is an ancient Iilmaraan poison

537
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:36,199
a parasitic fungus that has colonized your race

538
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:40,000
it is a trick that desert pygmees played on you

539
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:44,600
for humiliating them stripping them of their land

540
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:45,891
you mean alcohol

541
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:49,925
correct my small-skulled servant

542
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:55,916
enough I need you to open the door

543
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,205
no you don't

544
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:00,575
 you need to get another drink

545
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:06,638
occidental haplogroup B4 is done giving orders around here

546
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,475
the influence of the *ham sandwich race* is waning

547
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:15,066
show him the ham still got it

548
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,033
fucking yeah authority

549
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:27,433
I am the police and I need you to comply now

550
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,266
or do I ask him to help me do my job

551
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,833
there's no way I can

552
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,900
I'm gonna get my fucking ass beat aren't I

553
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,316
what do I do here Kim

554
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:45,400
Kim let's get Kim involved I need your help

555
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,266
why is he standing so far away from me

556
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,600
I just noticed that

557
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,275
Kim

558
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,300
I need you up here

559
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:57,458
I'm just gonna try to rationalize with him

560
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,433
 begging for help 

561
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:02,566
attempting to pass fear for cooperation

562
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:06,300
how far the occidental haplogroup has fallen

563
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:10,400
you were once a noble and powerful race

564
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:11,533
yeah let's get Kim involved

565
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,766
you gave the world *eugenics* electricity

566
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:21,541
and powerful weapons of war like missiles and aerostatic aircraft

567
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,250
you made great gains in metallurgy race theory and statecraft

568
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:31,116
you dominated lesser cultures

569
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:36,500
like the deformed Himeans and the inexplicably potato-obsessed Kojkos

570
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,300
but now your ascend to the genetic summit has halted

571
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:46,833
you are obsessed with sadness and with frivolous pop culture

572
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,866
you've got me all figured out buddy

573
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:51,000
you will be superseded

574
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,666
isn't that right babe

575
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,000
it is baby yeah you know it

576
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:00,033
isn't she a part of the ham sandwich collective

577
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,800
that he is deriding so much

578
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,700
there is a button right behind him

579
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,766
just out of reach

580
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:08,599
it must be the one that opens the door to the harbour

581
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:13,433
push him out of the way no

582
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,166
I need you to move 20 centimeters

583
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,718
whoa this

584
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm just gonna cut right to the chase

585
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,800
enough with this begging

586
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:38,233
you should leave the stage of history with dignity

587
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:42,966
by inviting the other races to a *great world war*

588
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:47,633
bring your troops to the Semenine Islands and to Boogie Street 

589
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:49,700
and we will pulverize you

590
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,100
when you are gone we will build a museum for you

591
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,166
the walls will be lined with bottles of *Al Gul*

592
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,904
your beloved beverage

593
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:07,235
 inside we will store the odes to homo-sexuality you call art 

594
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:10,233
and your microcephalic skulls

595
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:18,050
okay I have a 42% chance to knock this motherfucker out

596
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,433
I mean it's about defeating racism right

597
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:25,066
I can retry this one

598
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,000
do I have any skill points I do

599
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
let's fucking go

600
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,566
let's drop one into physical instrument and go for it

601
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,966
or I could become a racism

602
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,300
oh

603
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,766
nah

604
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:42,300
I don't think I don't think I'm gonna go with that one

605
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,833
save the skill point

606
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,266
time to get physical I feel like I kind of have to

607
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,800
this is redemption for Cuno alright as Cuno's...

608
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:59,766
as Cuno's Pig what better thing can I do

609
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,800
than try to knock this guy out

610
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
let's whittle in about down a little bit

611
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,133
with some dialogue

612
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,366
oh don't be vulgar

613
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,666
white or not has got little to do with this

614
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,200
the *race enigma* runs much deeper than that

615
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,266
it could impress Kuno it could

616
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:26,500
there must be some friction there

617
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,900
he's keeping it well hidden however

618
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,266
good point authority

619
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:33,733
only invest points after the failing

620
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,000
yeah I can retry it

621
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,900
you still surf him how does that factor into your life

622
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,400
oh we're gonna wheel him down and then suck him

623
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:49,600
Mr Claire is a man of vision and means

624
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:54,300
he has the will to confront antarma shunal capital

625
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,600
which is something *your* race navistic communists never did 

626
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,333
let's fucking defeat racism chat

627
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,133
also

628
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,100
to serve is noble

629
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,366
it takes discipline

630
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,533
your petulant individualism has only

631
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:14,866
contributed to your *race failure*

632
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,366
it is lax and moronic

633
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,933
my jam is a mysterious fourth thing

634
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,800
jam

635
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,133
individualism

636
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,700
you have gotten these

637
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,000
ideas from degenerate you've culture have you not

638
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:38,700
you have picked them up from rock and roll songs

639
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,170
she is the definition of cool and 

640
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,566
the cultural center of this world 

641
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:44,933
as far as I'm concerned

642
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,366
I've gotten it from disco actually

643
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:53,184
offshoots of the semenese people invented disco  

644
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:57,366
while having sex under the influence of cocaine 

645
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,527
it is a shame upon my race

646
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,933
but what is done is done

647
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,533
you have heard enough

648
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:08,733
about our phylogenetic secrets for today

649
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,700
you have extinction to come to terms with

650
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,800
and *never* getting him into the harbor

651
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:19,533
let's get Kim involved Kim what do you think about this

652
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:22,100
I think this racist is better than the last

653
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:25,066
but the next racist will be the really good one

654
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,500
okay that's a good line

655
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:32,200
I like the previous racist better actually

656
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
that is understandable

657
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:43,800
the previous racist was probably at occidental

658
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:47,000
did not prove a real adversary

659
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,533
this guy is advanced racism

660
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,600
these cops are just jealous Jean-Luc

661
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:53,100
just jealous

662
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,933
let's ask him about his stupid tattoos then

663
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:56,733
how about that

664
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,166
make a fool of them

665
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,800
racists are generally not

666
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,466
very good examples of their race

667
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,166
I am not like them

668
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,533
I am chraniometric perfection

669
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,366
I have taken the trouble to

670
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,700
permanently draw a freenologic grid

671
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,600
on my skull and features

672
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:23,366
this should dispel any doubt

673
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,666
so not only are you a racist

674
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:28,466
you subscribe to fraudulent

675
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,366
scientific theory about phrenology

676
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,166
that is a noble cranium

677
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,466
but you got a hard noggin yourself

678
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:40,933
I do I do physical instrument my noggin is pretty hard

679
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,266
you sure I'm not craniometrically superior to you

680
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:50,533
you exhibit forward projection of the jaw

681
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:56,700
indicative of schizophrenia and sexual inaccountability

682
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,500
from a purely aesthetic standpoint

683
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:04,766
the dimple in your jaw makes you look like a baby

684
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:07,466
this is not craniomtry

685
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:10,133
just an observation

686
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:10,866
what else

687
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,566
it is impossible to see any more of your bone structure

688
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:15,333
it is impossible to see any more of your bone structure

689
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:19,700
it is covered in the ravages of al gul

690
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:26,366
from what remain of your features I can see *fleshy lips*

691
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,666
*baldness of the head*

692
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,166
and long arms relative to lower limbs

693
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:39,566
this leads me to conclude you are not a police officer

694
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:42,600
you are a common criminal

695
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:48,066
an offspring of murderers and sailors from SUR-LA-CLEF

696
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,400
and Vesper

697
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:55,566
and possibly even the degenerate shee headers of *UBI*

698
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:59,566
interesting so my ancestors was Sir Lucklefe and the other one 

699
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:02,733
your racial heritage is uninteresting

700
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:06,733
it is the same as all revacholians

701
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,412
your parents and their parents  

702
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:12,200
made the decision to reproduce

703
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,466
while under the influence of al gul

704
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,566
that's the only reason you are here 

705
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,966
he's right there

706
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,800
it's almost impossible to get it on

707
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,933
unless you're both drunk

708
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,600
it's too scary when people are sober

709
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,300
all right

710
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,600
let's fucking do it

711
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:36,266
let's fucking swing if I'm gonna get any checks

712
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:38,533
hand it back to me

713
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:42,900
it's gotta be this one for for all of the fucking

714
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:47,000
non racists out here let's knock him out

715
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:48,800
Kim back me up

716
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,900
fucking let's go

717
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:59,600
just like that instinct took over

718
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,266
a solid strike straight into his throat

719
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,933
into the cartilage

720
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,966
you can swear you felt the soft palate break

721
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,400
let's fucking go

722
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:12,500
the man is reeling gasping for air

723
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,133
time stands still around you

724
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:16,466
in the distance

725
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,866
the sounds of the harbor are falling silent laughs

726
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,533
yeah so how about that fucking Al Ghul defeats racism

727
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:27,333
all you hear is a small gurglin sound

728
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,733
as a trickle of blood appears on the mess

729
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:35,066
okay there's no way I can do a 360 flying spin kick

730
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,300
let's rip into him with a right hook

731
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:40,200
or can I fail this

732
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,400
360 spin is there spin to win

733
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,566
can I fail this

734
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,066
should I try it

735
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,466
do it

736
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:54,191
fuck it

737
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:55,300
fuck it

738
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,566
Raphael

739
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:01,800
no fucking way

740
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:06,000
the man lands while a dull thump

741
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:10,000
like a broken down puppet of muscles and sinew

742
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:13,866
for a moment he still tries to keep his head up

743
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:18,400
dazed eyes looking at you with unimaginable suprise

744
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:22,000
to your left is *the button*

745
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
the coolest thing to do here would to be say

746
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
nothing right

747
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:27,366
just press the button

748
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,500
fucking let's go

749
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,266
as you slam your fist on the button

750
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,266
the man collapses entirely

751
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,466
his head rolling to the side

752
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:38,900
yeah what do these fucking ladies have to say about that 

753
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,466
Cuno would be so proud of me

754
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,866
looks like you're the new measure head now

755
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,066
I'm measure head dude

756
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:46,200
Cuno is gonna think I'm the fucking coolest

757
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,300
her voice is surprisingly calm

758
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,566
no one is the new measure head

759
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,300
let's go before he gets up

760
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,966
let's go let's fucking go

761
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,666
get wrecked

762
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,133
the man is still knocked out

763
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:04,700
he breathes slowly and steadily

764
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:10,666
all right well let's check out what's in that box first

765
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,666
maybe there's some trash

766
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,166
I'm rewarded for my efforts

767
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,266
let's go let's go

768
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,800
that was the best outcome I could have hoped for

769
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,800
I can't catch the coin but I can knock out fucking

770
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:32,100
a giant racist man

771
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,150
Knoked him out good..

772
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,300
like the Flying Desperado

773
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,466
what is the Flying Desperado

774
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:43,200
it is that really cool

775
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,766
flying desperado spin kick you did boiadeiro

776
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,200
often performed by

777
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,733
the most hard-bodied boiadeiros on the steppes

778
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,600
that was nothing

779
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
so what's on your mind this time

780
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,566
yeah good talking to you I just wanted to get your

781
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,333
impression on my fucking sick move

782
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,300
let's pop in here

783
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:05,666
all right we're in

784
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,966
I love how there was an option to

785
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,017
become racist 

786
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,200
that I could fail

787
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,333
but try again like

788
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:16,600
somehow I could go away

789
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:19,933
become more racist and then convince him that I

790
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,400
subscribed his ideology

791
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:23,866
what does it look like to fail racism

792
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:25,333
with someone that you'd assume would be

793
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,900
more than happy that someone was trying to be racist

794
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,600
oh he just you can deny it later that makes sense

795
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,500
okay let's check out our environment really quick

796
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,200
every worker a member of the board

797
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,866
what we got over here

798
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,966
we've got a postcard

799
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,566
probably sell that for some cash

800
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,333
see here coffee machine like the sound of that

801
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,066
on second glance 

802
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:12,148
on second glance 

803
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:15,700
someone has forgotten to properly close one of the drawers 

804
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,400
that's gotta be an Inland Empire thing

805
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,533
it's unfortunate for the union

806
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,300
to just leave the paperwork laying around like these

807
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:25,333
let's see what's inside he thinks

808
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:26,421
open the drawer 

809
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:28,383
the drawer opens smoothly

810
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:33,000
inside is a well organized selection of brown folders

811
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,866
browse them

812
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:37,266
hundreds of documents containing logistical data

813
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,200
two kinds of transactions stand out

814
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:44,366
materials coming into Revachol from the outside world

815
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,366
from Muindi Grod and even ilmara

816
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:50,766
I like to think that shining the flashlight on them

817
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:52,133
makes me be able to read them better

818
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,733
and the same materials being handed over

819
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:57,766
to companies inside Rivershaw

820
00:40:57,866 --> 00:41:00,000
Couron Coal City

821
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,133
LA Delta and Jamrock

822
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,085
are listed among the many districts

823
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:06,333
where the imports are being sold

824
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,900
it's hard to make sense of this thicket of company names 

825
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,700
dates quantities and percentages

826
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,366
you try to focus but the lines are getting blurry

827
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,600
oh 83 percent

828
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,500
I mean I can't fail that right

829
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,300
every time I say that though I fail it

830
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,766
I'm definitely gonna succeed at this let's try that

831
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:34,000
look how blurry all the lines on these papers are

832
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:37,466
how unwieldy your own willpower is to yourself

833
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,133
you're like an absurdist Samuran monk

834
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,366
focusing through not focusing

835
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,466
it's unbelievable

836
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:47,000
it's actually unbelievable

837
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,866
I defeated racism

838
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:51,800
I defeat

839
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,066
this is such a weird playthrough

840
00:41:58,366 --> 00:41:59,600
what the fuck

841
00:41:59,966 --> 00:42:02,133
Raphael what's wrong with you

842
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:04,300
do I have a point still yeah

843
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:06,666
I do

844
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:12,100
what was that one for

845
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:16,400
I guess I should probably put something in volition

846
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,300
was that what I failed at yeah

847
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,900
I wasn't too far off

848
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,825
I spent all my luck 

849
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,766
too high on nicotine to read

850
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:36,266
is that what you're doing with those folders over there

851
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:41,966
no of course not

852
00:42:41,966 --> 00:42:46,066
my thought exactly officer shall we

853
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,366
okay should I put one in volition for other reasons

854
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:56,733
I mean I'm kind of like mainlining my psyche here

855
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,800
and I feel like I've messed up some volition checks

856
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:03,500
makes you hypersane when you're about to get funky

857
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
it keeps you normal

858
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,100
I do need some help keeping myself in check

859
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:11,566
I'm losing morale daily here

860
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,966
volition to balance out my crazy side

861
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:19,300
yeah I have to agree there

862
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,266
what other checks could I do that's a good question

863
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,100
oh one of these was with Kim

864
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:29,266
what was it

865
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:33,466
map information in complete

866
00:43:33,466 --> 00:43:34,533
I thought I had a map

867
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:39,366
didn't I have a map earlier

868
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:42,966
the drawer slights shut smooth 

869
00:43:45,966 --> 00:43:47,566
what the fuck I thought I had a map

870
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,266
don't metagame that checks too hard

871
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:53,966
I mean

872
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:55,166
I still feel like

873
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,500
volition was is a worthwhile one to spec into here

874
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:02,466
I know you can get them from things as well

875
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:05,166
oh I just don't have a map of this area okay

876
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:09,933
to be a good guy to yourself

877
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,600
to others and yourself

878
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,733
I feel like that's important

879
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,066
for the healing of my character

880
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,066
the will to finish the investigation

881
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:20,733
well I need that my guy keeps getting sidetracked

882
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,300
okay we're gonna level this up I feel like it's

883
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,866
not something that I can really

884
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:29,800
it's not gonna

885
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,766
chat:所以你*确实*想要治疗？

886
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,266
I do want to heal I do

887
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:35,499
the whole game is gonna be about psychological healing for me 

888
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:40,366
I feel like I can't lose if I before I

889
00:44:40,366 --> 00:44:42,866
the file cabinet stands steady as ever

890
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,466
and the unlocked drawer slides out to greet you

891
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,466
92 percent that's a mighty success rate let's go

892
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,600
whatever's hidden here is hidden well

893
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:56,966
concentration isn't enough

894
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,466
only a trained accountant with a background in logistics 

895
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:03,166
would be able to *really* make sense of it

896
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:06,931
however there *is* a little hand-written note

897
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:08,833
 stuck on the side of the drawer 

898
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:09,426
look at the note

899
00:45:09,426 --> 00:45:10,943
it appears to be a to-do list 

900
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:14,092
written in large uneven capital letters 

901
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:15,859
remember Leo 

902
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:17,600
*Everarts shoes

903
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,443
*special whirling borscht 

904
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:21,800
*water Evrart's plants

905
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,636
*sweep office floor 

906
00:45:23,636 --> 00:45:24,900
*more banners

907
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:32,033
all items on the list have been crossed out

908
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:34,800
 and the note itself is crumpled 

909
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:36,775
let's get Kim involved

910
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,100
 Evrart Claire probably the head of the Débardeurs' Union

911
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,616
one of his aids must have left it nothing incriminating here

912
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:49,166
what is so special about this *borscht*

913
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:53,041
code for drugs booze blood 

914
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,633
let's take another look here

915
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,456
remember Leo 

916
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:57,566
*Everarts shoes

917
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,362
*special whirling borscht 

918
00:45:59,362 --> 00:46:01,700
*water Evrart's plants

919
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,500
*sweep office floor

920
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:07,466
all items on the list have been crossed out

921
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:10,033
and the note itself is crumpled

922
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,500
hmm okay

923
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,366
the drawer slides shut smoothly

924
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:18,675
all right I'm not sure exactly what we learned from that but

925
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,700
I'm sure it will prove valuable

926
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,400
what do we got what do we got here

927
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,083
looks like someone left his tarpaulin cloak 

928
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:31,900
hanging on the railing here

929
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:35,123
the white rectangle of the Revachol Citizens Militia

930
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:37,250
 is clearly visible on its back

931
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,525
this is *your* cloak 

932
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:40,375
what

933
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:41,466
you can feel it

934
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:45,658
let's ask Kim does he think it's my coat

935
00:46:45,658 --> 00:46:48,600
yes it does bear RCM insignia

936
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,900
and we're the only detectives in Martinaise

937
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,765
maybe it has my badge in it Kim 

938
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:54,896
 the service cloak issued to you by your station

939
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,351
 yes yes I do

940
00:46:56,351 --> 00:46:58,392
as your fingers touch the tarpauling

941
00:46:58,392 --> 00:46:59,032
 oh fuck yes

942
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:01,833
it almost feels like the cloak wants to deliver

943
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:04,500
a message of comfort through your fingertips

944
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,100
yes 

945
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,400
*I will shield you from the elements and give you my life for yours*

946
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:11,666
that's what the cloak is relaying

947
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:13,966
okay

948
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:16,841
fucking finally

949
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:22,732
shivers absolutely going for it

950
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,633
look at my dude

951
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,100
fucking

952
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,233
badass

953
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:35,000
okay what is it doing up here is my next question

954
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,450
this is a very cop like coat

955
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,900
right now the answer to good benefits is it's me

956
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:53,100
no I don't think I'm ready to look in the mirror just yet 

957
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,350
all those empty wine bottles and cigarette butts on the ground

958
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:04,600
someone *partied* really really hard here

959
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,000
did I do this

960
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,833
well yes I think we can say with relative confidence that it was you 

961
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,800
oh this is really sad I must have been miserable

962
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,209
see this is the kind of introspection 

963
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:18,066
I have been looking for right

964
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,433
every new moment that gets me in touch with who I was

965
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,700
challenges my character

966
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:28,466
on do I want to integrate these things

967
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,366
because I have the strong sensation that

968
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,021
Raphael does not have very positive feelings

969
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:37,032
 about the person he was before he woke up

970
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,066
and this is very much the experience

971
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:42,633
of people who I work with in addiction

972
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:45,481
where they're reflecting on like 

973
00:48:45,481 --> 00:48:48,633
who they were when they were in their addiction

974
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:52,566
they do not have positive feelings about who this person was 

975
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:55,366
and so there is a strong urge to like

976
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:57,425
let's move on from them

977
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,957
but we neglect the idea that

978
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:03,326
there are valuable things left in who you were

979
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,304
that we can integrate with

980
00:49:06,304 --> 00:49:08,083
 the person you're trying to be right

981
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:10,966
it is not an all or nothing process like

982
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,754
integrating the past parts of your identity with your present one  

983
00:49:14,754 --> 00:49:18,166
it's way harder than saying let's just start clean 

984
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:24,166
but it's a lot more impactful if you're able to do it right 

985
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:27,264
it's impactful if you're able to sort out things like

986
00:49:27,545 --> 00:49:31,500
 the fact that someone who was selling narcotics 

987
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,266
gain some valuable skills from this

988
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:37,233
is able to read and understand people very well

989
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:39,600
knows how to put pressure on someone

990
00:49:40,492 --> 00:49:43,236
to the degree where they 

991
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:45,600
you know get what they owed from them

992
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,092
but not doing so that they might 

993
00:49:47,092 --> 00:49:49,900
remove a repeating customer 

994
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,233
were these used for good intentions no

995
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,728
but these are valuable like psychosocial skills 

996
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:59,166
 that are not worthy of abandonment right 

997
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,185
and that's something I legitimately work on 

998
00:50:01,185 --> 00:50:03,243
with people in recovery all the time

999
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:06,783
 which is we have to understand that 

1000
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:13,700
the qualities you have are not what made you a bad person

1001
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,875
or made your decisions bad 

1002
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:20,200
it's the decision making that wasn't in your best interest 

1003
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,708
and that decision making was influenced by the addiction

1004
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:26,600
and all kinds of other life pressures

1005
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:30,633
and so here's what I imagine my character doing it's like

1006
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:34,866
he doesn't want to integrate his past

1007
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:35,981
I can sense that 

1008
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:38,419
like in the way that I haven't looked in the mirror yet

1009
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:42,466
I know it's kind of odd that I haven't done that 

1010
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:45,261
but it's part of a role playing decision  

1011
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:49,633
and it's also like how I genuinely understand

1012
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:52,638
people in recovery to experience this

1013
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,207
because he's not ready he's not sure yet

1014
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:59,536
 if there are things about his past self  

1015
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:02,300
that are worth bringing forward right 

1016
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:06,266
that's kind of the struggle that he is in right now

1017
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:10,751
and I think finding his coat finding his badge

1018
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:14,800
starting to see the destruction that he left

1019
00:51:14,966 --> 00:51:17,900
both in his own life and just to his own body

1020
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:21,791
are the early signs of like

1021
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:27,966
is that person I was worth saving something from 

1022
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,066
or is it all bad

1023
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:34,262
and that's some of the that's the line of questioning

1024
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:36,566
I would probably go into therapy with with him 

1025
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,975
but yeah I think that

1026
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,800
that's a question I often ask people in recovery

1027
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:47,516
what is worthwhile about who you were that's

1028
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:51,700
something you want to keep

1029
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,139
let's go with some self reflection here

1030
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:58,966
 yes this scene isn't exactly ripping with joy 

1031
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,700
let's just move on

1032
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,141
sympathetic I understand

1033
00:52:05,466 --> 00:52:06,266
Kim

1034
00:52:07,175 --> 00:52:10,033
wants me to avoid feeling sad but I do need this

1035
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:18,000
I need this Kim I need to face who I was

1036
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,300
or my healing to take place

1037
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:26,300
this is the nightwatchman's booth

1038
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:30,033
the name on the door reads *René Arnoux*

1039
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:32,800
so this is where René works I'm gonna look around

1040
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,700
if you must

1041
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:36,766
but please hurry we are pretty easy to spot up here

1042
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,625
equip the bag

1043
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:40,571
oh I forgot I wasn't holding my bag

1044
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:42,600
nothing incriminating catches your eye

1045
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,262
the cabinets are clean 

1046
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:47,633
and their sparse contents meticulously organized 

1047
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:50,100
there's a framed photograph on the table

1048
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,285
 let's get that picture

1049
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:55,925
it's a black and white photo of a young couple out in a street fair

1050
00:52:56,233 --> 00:53:00,500
the man René is dressed in a Royal Carabineer uniform

1051
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,066
the girl is young and very pretty

1052
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,066
she is smiling playfully at the camera

1053
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,166
Renee looks like he's about to smile

1054
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:11,500
this photo must be tied to some good memories

1055
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,300
why did you take that picture of René

1056
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:19,966
I'm gonna ask him about that

1057
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:22,600
you're *really* interested in that old soldier

1058
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,989
not sure I understand your fascination 

1059
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:26,400
but sure

1060
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,366
as long as it doesn't take up a whole lot of time

1061
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:29,525
oh

1062
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:32,970
buddy everything we do takes up a lot of time

1063
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:38,900
okay I totally forgot that I have to equip my bag here

1064
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,566
I don't need to be holding my cigarettes at all times

1065
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:45,291
even though it does make me feel comfortable 

1066
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:53,716
let's pick up these bottles

1067
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,200
oh I can take all of them

1068
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:03,400
I'm rich

1069
00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:05,533
I'm gonna be fucking wealthy

1070
00:54:14,633 --> 00:54:15,333
perfect

1071
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:19,577
what about in the windows 

1072
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:22,075
all good can't do anything there

1073
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,700
umm let's see here

1074
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,100
let's go check out that door

1075
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,916
okay I think that was all I could do up here

1076
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,166
I think we might be a communist

1077
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:41,745
also I'm gonna be fucking wealthy 

1078
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,075
hell yes we are

1079
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:46,566
look wealth is how I gain 

1080
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:50,300
the influence to help the people

1081
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:52,825
that's how we do it

1082
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,200
an imposing combination of a punch clock

1083
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,466
and a payphone is looking down at you from the wall

1084
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:03,100
a note on the side says

1085
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:07,466
tokens unavailable due to strike use change

1086
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,425
I did just pick up some cash

1087
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,966
the machine swallows your coin

1088
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,866
and seems to be waiting for your next move

1089
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,158
I've been here before huh

1090
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:24,300
let's try it out

1091
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:28,066
it's unclear whether you actually have muscle memory

1092
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,116
right now your finger is just drawing

1093
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:32,266
vaguely occult patterns in the air

1094
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,333
god damn it

1095
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,166
I might try this again

1096
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,633
undoubtedly no

1097
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:41,500
sure why not muscle memory is a tricky thing

1098
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,400
nothing tricky about that

1099
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:46,866
you just do fail repeat

1100
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,366
until it works

1101
00:55:48,566 --> 00:55:51,800
all it takes is motivation and practice

1102
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,400
okay I guess there were some stairs that I missed

1103
00:55:58,766 --> 00:56:00,366
are these ones okay

1104
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,100
what do we got here

1105
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:13,500
White Pine trees are printed onto the screen covering

1106
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,066
looks like a forest under snow

1107
00:56:27,566 --> 00:56:28,333
what's this

1108
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:31,266
a rusting control panel with several knobs

1109
00:56:31,466 --> 00:56:36,933
two buttons marked *Marche* and *Arret* are faded with use

1110
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:39,800
it seems to control the large crane above

1111
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,466
a container is attached to its hook block

1112
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:53,100
marche on

1113
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,500
arret of 

1114
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:01,000
rusting control panel with several knobs

1115
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,400
two buttons marked *Marche*

1116
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,100
sorry I was distracted by something

1117
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,200
hello there this is editor Brady

1118
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,533
my apologies for

1119
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:14,766
interrupting your viewing of the episode

1120
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:16,866
but I just wanted to

1121
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,400
mention for those who didn't catch this stream live

1122
00:57:21,466 --> 00:57:23,533
around now in the play through

1123
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:27,133
I started to like really lose a lot of focus because

1124
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:28,364
I started to notice there was

1125
00:57:28,364 --> 00:57:32,366
 a whole bunch of spam comments happening in the chat 

1126
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,800
and so my focus was kind of like all over the place

1127
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,366
trying to like ban these people

1128
00:57:36,766 --> 00:57:39,200
um but the longer it went on

1129
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,400
we started to realize that like

1130
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,900
we were just getting like bot rated or something 

1131
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,595
there were just like hundreds of people 

1132
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,525
coming in and following all at once 

1133
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:49,366
and just spamming the same comments 

1134
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,166
so

1135
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,900
there's a couple of times during this whole like

1136
00:57:53,466 --> 00:57:55,966
part at the docks that like I'm not

1137
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,585
you know paying 

1138
00:57:57,585 --> 00:57:59,666
the closest attention to what's happening 

1139
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,900
um and it actually did have to like 

1140
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,933
end the play through early because of it

1141
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:05,533
so if you see me like

1142
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:08,566
looking away from the game at important moments

1143
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:10,266
uh that's why like

1144
00:58:10,266 --> 00:58:12,533
chat was just being totally overrun with these things

1145
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:14,266
so my apologies for that

1146
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,866
and uh yeah editor Brady out

1147
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:26,700
container is trashed to its hook block

1148
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:29,500
I mean let's turn it on

1149
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,733
with a loud grind the crane shifts overhead

1150
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,533
moving a massive metal container through the air

1151
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:40,266
and with a surprisingly quiet thunk

1152
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:42,800
the crane places the container down

1153
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:45,166
this crane was built with a purpose

1154
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:46,966
which has now been fulfilled

1155
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,566
to move this container

1156
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:51,266
what's inside the container

1157
00:58:51,266 --> 00:58:54,733
who can say all you know is it's special

1158
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:57,200
I can't see how that was worth the ruckus

1159
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:59,400
except for seeing the crane in action

1160
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,500
which I admit was satisfying

1161
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,800
okay

1162
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,333
let's go inspect

1163
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,866
some cash all right

1164
00:59:15,466 --> 00:59:17,266
oh and something that can heal me

1165
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:19,566
thank goodness

1166
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:25,800
so was this a container

1167
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,500
before you stands a cargo container

1168
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,800
just one of many in the yard

1169
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:33,100
lieutenant

1170
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,733
I think there's something special about this container

1171
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:36,533
you do

1172
00:59:36,966 --> 00:59:38,000
because I don't

1173
00:59:39,066 --> 00:59:41,133
there are a million containers here

1174
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,300
why are you fixing on this one

1175
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,866
it was hanging from the crane

1176
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,466
maybe there's contraband in there

1177
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:50,349
there may very well be

1178
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:52,166
 but we are not here to look for that 

1179
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:55,566
we are not here to interact with containers

1180
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,000
we are here to interview the union boss

1181
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,866
well we did say that we would investigate the drug trade

1182
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:03,491
we did say that Kim

1183
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:08,166
you attempt to turn the handle to no avail

1184
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:11,300
the doors seem to be mechanically locked

1185
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,700
to your left the lieutenant considers your actions

1186
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:16,066
with some puzzlement

1187
01:00:16,733 --> 01:00:17,533
no reply

1188
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:23,700
let's persuade the door to open

1189
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,933
3% I mean

1190
01:00:26,766 --> 01:00:27,766
what's the harm right

1191
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,133
why are you even trying to open a door with rhetoric

1192
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:36,300
because getting physical wasn't an option

1193
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:40,666
now is not the time to get philosophical detective

1194
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:42,466
you can do that after hours

1195
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:43,466
okay

1196
01:00:43,966 --> 01:00:45,941
somehow we'll have to get this door open

1197
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,100
but we won't be able to do it right now

1198
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,566
can try this white once every day

1199
01:01:03,566 --> 01:01:06,000
I don't think we're gonna put any points into rhetoric

1200
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,800
so

1201
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,300
oh I've got some money here

1202
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,558
I'm fucking rolling in cash right now

1203
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:15,300
four real that's enough for two packs of cigarettes almost

1204
01:01:18,733 --> 01:01:21,300
oh I do have a crowbar yes

1205
01:01:22,066 --> 01:01:23,200
let's get the crowbar

1206
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:27,166
fucking that door is coming open now

1207
01:01:27,766 --> 01:01:30,266
look I was able to knock out the racist

1208
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:33,400
if I can't get this door open I am truly lost

1209
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:36,300
let's go let's fucking go

1210
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,466
I will bust this thing open

1211
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:39,800
you're back before the cargo container

1212
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:40,916
open it

1213
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:42,366
you attempt to turn the handle

1214
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,866
to no avail

1215
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,500
to your left the lieutenant considers your actions

1216
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:48,800
with some puzzlement

1217
01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:51,933
I can't open this with the crow

1218
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,933
the package not the door okay

1219
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:01,700
oh wait there's some money

1220
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,491
why is there just a bunch of money hanging around out there

1221
01:02:12,066 --> 01:02:12,933
what we got

1222
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,900
oh some gloves

1223
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:25,300
okay so I can swap these for my interfacing ones

1224
01:02:26,066 --> 01:02:27,533
the union is rich

1225
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,133
that's a good point

1226
01:02:31,566 --> 01:02:33,733
mechanically sealed shipping crates are stronger than a

1227
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,700
pseudoscientific Übermensch

1228
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,733
look I just figured that

1229
01:02:39,733 --> 01:02:41,900
if I could defeat racism with a punch

1230
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:45,333
then I should be able to pry open those doors

1231
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:54,133
wait there's a gentleman here

1232
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:56,466
let's ask him what he thinks about the situation

1233
01:02:56,466 --> 01:02:59,900
container container I'll turn you nice and red

1234
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:03,975
container container put the logos on

1235
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,366
I've been having a lot of luck with my interactions 

1236
01:03:08,366 --> 01:03:10,133
when I point the flashlight directly at them

1237
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:11,600
I feel like it's sort of a power play

1238
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,400
so I'm gonna keep doing that

1239
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,866
the accent is so thick it's impossible not to notice

1240
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:17,016
he's Ubi

1241
01:03:17,275 --> 01:03:21,391
from the vanishing Peninsula of Ubi Sunt?(sic)on Mundi

1242
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:22,566
okay

1243
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:25,850
container container used to be Wild Pines

1244
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:30,600
container container now belongs to Evrart

1245
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:33,766
Hello

1246
01:03:33,766 --> 01:03:37,650
Evrart Evrart Evrart he looks after everyone

1247
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,400
well

1248
01:03:39,533 --> 01:03:41,900
hey there how can I help you mister

1249
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:44,066
the look in his deep blue eyes

1250
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:46,466
is as sincere as you've ever seen

1251
01:03:46,933 --> 01:03:50,388
kind of makes you feel like an asshole for no apparent reason

1252
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:55,400
what did I say about social comparison right like

1253
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,366
it makes complete sense that seeing someone so jovial

1254
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,449
makes me immediately recognize 

1255
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:06,766
the contrast in my own mental health 

1256
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,600
I see you are not a union man Mister

1257
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:11,900
did you get lost

1258
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:13,600
you're not one of them scabs are you

1259
01:04:14,933 --> 01:04:17,100
I am not a scab no

1260
01:04:18,866 --> 01:04:19,933
what is it with you people

1261
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:22,000
I mean I don't personally mind

1262
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,650
folks are just folks you know and folks gotta eat

1263
01:04:26,466 --> 01:04:27,900
just some of the other guys

1264
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,966
don't look too kindly on the scabbing kind

1265
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,400
if you know what I mean Mister

1266
01:04:32,766 --> 01:04:33,533
you're Ubi right

1267
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:36,100
Oh yes born and raised in Iraesh Mister

1268
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,766
Mum had to leave my dad after he got a bit violent

1269
01:04:38,866 --> 01:04:40,600
took us here to the new new world

1270
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,800
I was about 10 then too old to lose my accent then

1271
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,733
people say us

1272
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:46,200
Ubis are up to all sorts of

1273
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,566
trouble with sheep and other animals and what not

1274
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:49,772
I just want you to know 

1275
01:04:49,772 --> 01:04:52,300
there was never any of that where I come from 

1276
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,266
no sir those are just nasty rumours

1277
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,300
thank you for clarifying that sir

1278
01:04:58,716 --> 01:04:59,666
okay

1279
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,566
where is everyone

1280
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:04,133
oh most of the guys are down at the gates

1281
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,900
keeping the scabs from coming in

1282
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:07,500
we're on a strike

1283
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,100
the whole union is

1284
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:11,441
you don't have to work when you're on strike

1285
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,666
we haven't worked for two months now

1286
01:05:14,733 --> 01:05:15,600
I guess it's good

1287
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,700
no one is working

1288
01:05:17,966 --> 01:05:19,966
not everyone is down there of course

1289
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:23,266
Mr Evtart is in his office where he always is

1290
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,533
and Jean-Luc is guarding the gate

1291
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:27,008
not anymore

1292
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:30,700
but Titus and his boys got into some drunken trouble

1293
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,300
and Eva sent him on a nice vacation

1294
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,666
for a week or so

1295
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,500
um one second

1296
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,500
what kind of trouble did this Titus and his friends get into 

1297
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,666
to talk about that

1298
01:05:45,766 --> 01:05:47,400
that's union business

1299
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:49,966
sorry I'm a little distracted

1300
01:05:49,966 --> 01:05:51,209
because there's a bunch of people spamming

1301
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:52,900
 a bunch of bullshit in chat 

1302
01:05:54,066 --> 01:05:56,666
so I'm just trying to like clean them up

1303
01:05:57,575 --> 01:05:58,900
while I'm doing this

1304
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:01,533
I'm not really supposed to talk about that

1305
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:02,466
that's union vision

1306
01:06:02,466 --> 01:06:04,533
him and his boys stirred something up in town

1307
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:07,333
probably drank too much and got into a fight or something

1308
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:10,500
I heard Mr Evrart telling him to take some time off

1309
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,766
don't go all bad cop on this simple friendly fellow

1310
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:18,766
here's the thing

1311
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,875
every time I see someone

1312
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,360
who is in good mood 

1313
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,266
or approaches me with a very open posture

1314
01:06:24,266 --> 01:06:25,900
I'm immediately suspicious of them

1315
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:31,733
it happened with the very  

1316
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,866
approachable lady in the wheelchair

1317
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,166
however she immediately disarmed me with her

1318
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:40,133
I guess like

1319
01:06:40,566 --> 01:06:44,933
simple admiration of me and her very honest reflections

1320
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:50,200
guys mod team can we

1321
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,100
ban all of these people

1322
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:55,500
who are just spamming a bunch of bullshit

1323
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,600
I'm trying to do some of them myself but

1324
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,400
I'm suspicious because like

1325
01:07:01,716 --> 01:07:03,566
the natural conclusion

1326
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,487
that most of the people who like I encounter in this world  

1327
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:12,133
have some sort of issue

1328
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:13,200
they want something

1329
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:15,733
what does he want

1330
01:07:16,475 --> 01:07:17,666
what does he want from me

1331
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,575
I guess the boys got a bit too rowdy and had to let out some steam

1332
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:24,700
I don't really know the details

1333
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,500
that's just how boys are you know

1334
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,533
I haven't been in a fight since I was in middle school

1335
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,966
easy Leo let's keep this on the Hardies

1336
01:07:37,866 --> 01:07:40,333
too rowdy Leo what kind of a fight did they get into

1337
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,333
did they kill a mercenary

1338
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:44,300
too late Leo's mouth is still moving

1339
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,500
and the words are sprewing forth

1340
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:50,400
words words and look even more words

1341
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,733
this guy could go on until the end of days

1342
01:07:53,733 --> 01:07:54,733
what's he seen though

1343
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:58,266
now he's talking about some drunk Sawmill owner who

1344
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,200
no he already

1345
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,166
switched to a prized fishing rod

1346
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,333
he apparently owned at some point

1347
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:05,333
you know what

1348
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,300
just cut in there with your questions

1349
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,733
all right Leo what's up with the containers

1350
01:08:10,733 --> 01:08:13,566
oh I'm just making some covers for them containers here

1351
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,400
yes I am yes I am

1352
01:08:15,533 --> 01:08:18,333
so it's easier for the crane operators to spot them

1353
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:20,933
17 percent

1354
01:08:21,566 --> 01:08:24,766
I have not failed a 17 percenter yet

1355
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:31,566
17 percent is 100% so far it has been in my book

1356
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:34,700
everything is so pretty and red

1357
01:08:34,766 --> 01:08:36,507
you and Leo look like brothers

1358
01:08:36,507 --> 01:08:40,391
 as you glance around with similar childlike wonder 

1359
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:44,183
okay I'm starting to recognize

1360
01:08:44,183 --> 01:08:48,566
that my early luck was very very limited

1361
01:08:52,066 --> 01:08:53,800
I'll just keep the amazement to yourself

1362
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,366
and hums a jaunty to himself

1363
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:57,333
okay

1364
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,700
yes everybody needs a job and this is mine

1365
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,133
I'm Leonard by the way

1366
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:05,266
Leonard Bellec but everyone calls me Leo

1367
01:09:07,533 --> 01:09:08,466
oh my God

1368
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,866
every every time I ban someone there's another one

1369
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:13,066
fuck off

1370
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,041
I'm like Mr Evrart's right hand man

1371
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:19,966
when Mr Edgar is out of town

1372
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,825
and Mr Edgar's right hand man when Mr Evrart is away

1373
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,933
actually Ms Beaufort is the right hand man

1374
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:29,466
but she's a lady

1375
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,566
who is this Miss Beauforr

1376
01:09:34,533 --> 01:09:35,891
a real pretty lady

1377
01:09:35,891 --> 01:09:38,493
 with a skin like those 'Doux & Sucre' 

1378
01:09:38,493 --> 01:09:40,166
caddy bars my missus like so much 

1379
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:43,300
them are real nice to suckle on once the dinner is done

1380
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,900
and me and the messes sit down

1381
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,133
besides the radio

1382
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,733
but I can't listen to the radio all the time

1383
01:09:50,733 --> 01:09:52,350
there's so much to do around here

1384
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,933
and I'm always busy keeping things running here

1385
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,900
yes I am yes I am

1386
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,000
stay on this Miss Beaufort topic

1387
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,333
who is this Miss Beaufort

1388
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:02,075
oh Lizzie

1389
01:10:02,341 --> 01:10:04,500
she is a real sharp tool

1390
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,966
Mr. Evrart put her through some fancy school and everything 

1391
01:10:07,966 --> 01:10:09,166
east of the river

1392
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:10,900
four years she was gone

1393
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:14,333
and when she came back she was all fancy and loyerly

1394
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:19,933
yeah I am only lucky with the important checks

1395
01:10:19,933 --> 01:10:24,125
it's a good point that like a lot of these like very simple ones

1396
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,800
those are the ones I'm failing

1397
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,145
but I'm not having any trouble with like the major

1398
01:10:29,422 --> 01:10:30,635
 game defining ones 

1399
01:10:30,635 --> 01:10:31,900
 like shooting the guy down

1400
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:34,400
but she's a real nice girl

1401
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,333
grew up in this here neighborhood

1402
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,100
knows everybody and gets along with everyone

1403
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,166
real pillar of the community one day I'm sure

1404
01:10:42,933 --> 01:10:46,733
for a fraction of a second this sadness in his eyes

1405
01:10:48,733 --> 01:10:50,266
let's peel back the layers of Leo

1406
01:10:50,266 --> 01:10:51,933
if me missus and me was to have a child

1407
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:54,300
I'd be real happy if she turned out like her

1408
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,333
but she can't have kids

1409
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,500
oh fuck Leo

1410
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,533
and she knows about such things

1411
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,700
being a doctor for almost 50 years she has

1412
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,800
I think you're doing a great job around here Leo

1413
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,066
this place really seems to run like clockwork

1414
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,133
keep it up Leo

1415
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,466
well thanks a lot coming from you it means a lot really

1416
01:11:16,366 --> 01:11:17,200
sometimes I feel

1417
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,685
some of the guys don't really get 

1418
01:11:18,685 --> 01:11:20,700
how much I bust my ass for them here 

1419
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,266
but you guys are all right

1420
01:11:22,566 --> 01:11:24,900
the white rectangle on your clothes

1421
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,366
might not mean an awful lot in Martinaise

1422
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,866
but the recognition from an authority figure

1423
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,500
made Leo's day

1424
01:11:31,733 --> 01:11:33,300
oh look at that

1425
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:36,725
see here's another point that like I said

1426
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,533
sometimes people who are 

1427
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,616
really working through something difficult

1428
01:11:41,616 --> 01:11:43,166
especially like

1429
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:46,966
the relationship with yourself kind of thing

1430
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:50,266
they tend to overlook moments like this

1431
01:11:50,266 --> 01:11:52,333
where they actually do like

1432
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,250
do something that they should be proud of right

1433
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:00,867
I think that my guy would

1434
01:12:00,867 --> 01:12:04,566
 find it very easy to minimize situations like this 

1435
01:12:05,066 --> 01:12:05,900
where he would say well

1436
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,900
it was only because Kim was there that

1437
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,133
Leo felt good after we said that

1438
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:12,933
oh it's only because I was wearing the coat

1439
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:16,449
I think he would overlook and not necessarily assign  

1440
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:19,000
the fact that it was my dialogue with him and

1441
01:12:19,275 --> 01:12:23,350
the earnestness that we were having this conversation

1442
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,666
that actually made this guy's day right

1443
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:32,525
something about this interaction should tell Raphael

1444
01:12:32,525 --> 01:12:35,166
that like you have the capacity to be a good person

1445
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,733
and empathy I'm glad chimed in to let us know that

1446
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:42,600
but look I almost didn't succeed at that

1447
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:46,200
these are the kinds of narratives that I would want my

1448
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:48,100
character to focus on

1449
01:12:51,858 --> 01:12:53,600
are you the Leo who wrote the note to make more banners

1450
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,200
oh yes yes I leave all kinds of notes for myself

1451
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,266
that old head of mine

1452
01:12:58,266 --> 01:13:00,366
ain't so good at keeping things in no more

1453
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:02,666
I almost forgot about the borscht

1454
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:04,700
what was that about the borscht

1455
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,333
oh yes

1456
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:08,100
I've been taking special whirling borscht to the men

1457
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,666
every day since the strike started

1458
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,700
that's very very good

1459
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,166
makes a man feel so warm and happy

1460
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:19,000
I feel like I could take on Mr Renaudin's boardogs

1461
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,950
every time the lunch is done

1462
01:13:21,466 --> 01:13:25,386
see measurehead okay 

1463
01:13:25,386 --> 01:13:26,933
 a little bit of Al Gul

1464
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,133
is what is brightening up Leo's world

1465
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:31,266
look how happy he is

1466
01:13:31,266 --> 01:13:32,400
power borscht

1467
01:13:32,766 --> 01:13:34,500
never heard of a borscht that turns little

1468
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,100
guys into dogfighters

1469
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:38,333
alcohol however

1470
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:42,300
yes yes I'm taking it to them

1471
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:45,133
the borscht keeps them happy and in Fighting spirits

1472
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:46,766
makes you all warm inside

1473
01:13:46,766 --> 01:13:49,300
they brew it in the whirling in rags

1474
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,966
wait hold up is it the guy in the

1475
01:13:50,966 --> 01:13:52,600
in the kitchen who I couldn't talk to

1476
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,166
oh the whirlings cook

1477
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:55,566
he makes it

1478
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:56,033
It is

1479
01:13:56,033 --> 01:13:59,533
talking with Mr Manana in that weird language and laughing together

1480
01:13:59,566 --> 01:14:02,500
he doesn't speak what we speak he's from Graad

1481
01:14:02,566 --> 01:14:06,700
fuck okay Mr Manana is the guy we need to talk to then

1482
01:14:10,466 --> 01:14:11,666
looks like the borscht is spiking

1483
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:12,933
oh sure master

1484
01:14:13,133 --> 01:14:15,900
sure you do that yes sir

1485
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,300
what's in the container

1486
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,700
oh that one that should be empty as far as I know

1487
01:14:21,966 --> 01:14:24,366
lots of containers here have nothing in them

1488
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:26,333
they're just waiting to be loaded up

1489
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,300
told you

1490
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:30,933
Alright I'm looking for the leader

1491
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,600
oh you want Mr Evrart then

1492
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:34,700
he's an awfully nice fellow he is

1493
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,966
him and his brother are both nice fellows

1494
01:14:36,966 --> 01:14:39,766
they've lived their entire lives in this here neighborhood

1495
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,800
guys like Mr Evrart and Mr Edgar his brother

1496
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,100
are real good guys

1497
01:14:45,266 --> 01:14:47,066
made Martinaise what it is today

1498
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:49,466
Mr Evrart and Mr Edgar and I

1499
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,000
went to the same school we did

1500
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,300
when we were boys

1501
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,133
patience

1502
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,366
deep down you have the mental power to keep listening

1503
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,466
not many would but you do

1504
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,966
I'm glad I expected to volition for this

1505
01:15:03,133 --> 01:15:04,166
let's keep going

1506
01:15:05,466 --> 01:15:08,266
at an arithmetics teacher Miss Bellows

1507
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:11,000
her real name was Miss Bellams

1508
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,133
she was a real pretty lady but when she got mad

1509
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:16,800
all the boys liked her if you know what I mean Mister

1510
01:15:16,966 --> 01:15:19,100
we used to sneak in her yard in the dark and

1511
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,300
peek through the window

1512
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,866
one time we saw Miss Bellows with a fellow

1513
01:15:22,966 --> 01:15:25,266
yes we did yes we did Mister

1514
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,933
don't say anything

1515
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,700
or no I should play into it

1516
01:15:31,766 --> 01:15:34,866
yes we did we did master indeed we did

1517
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,800
Ham was a big big fellow

1518
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:40,000
used to drive the Troyka near our'ses school and everything 

1519
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,766
them was all naked too

1520
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,500
that's all I got to say about that

1521
01:15:45,066 --> 01:15:46,300
thank you for telling me the whole time

1522
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,800
thank you eh

1523
01:15:47,933 --> 01:15:48,933
almost forgot

1524
01:15:49,266 --> 01:15:52,066
Mr Evrart is usually in that container over there

1525
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,266
but he usually leaves around 10 PM

1526
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:56,266
so you got to be quick if you want to catch him

1527
01:15:57,066 --> 01:15:58,733
wait he's in the container

1528
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,989
lonesome long Way home

1529
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,900
ah this was the thought there we go

1530
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,333
home awaits

1531
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:14,066
walk past station 41 and through the market

1532
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,200
past the Boogie Street sparehead

1533
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,066
to the other side of the lake

1534
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:20,733
the frozen eye at the center of the district

1535
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:24,866
then past the video rental store on the corner

1536
01:16:24,866 --> 01:16:29,266
there at the end of a street lined with pine trees

1537
01:16:29,266 --> 01:16:32,666
a small house no larger than a matchbox

1538
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:35,000
11 Voyager Road

1539
01:16:35,366 --> 01:16:36,800
you no longer live there

1540
01:16:37,066 --> 01:16:38,500
those times are gone

1541
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,366
and so are those people

1542
01:16:40,933 --> 01:16:42,266
why did you come here

1543
01:16:42,566 --> 01:16:44,066
why are you still here

1544
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:46,100
and where's the dealer

1545
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,400
you have to get back to work

1546
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,133
that's all you have now

1547
01:16:51,075 --> 01:16:52,000
okay

1548
01:16:52,133 --> 01:16:53,750
some more insights into our past here

1549
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,900
what did we get

1550
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:59,700
our perceptions learning cap raise to 5

1551
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,700
speed gives one to sigh

1552
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:03,366
okay

1553
01:17:08,733 --> 01:17:10,133
so it seems like

1554
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:13,200
we're actually looking for Mr Evrart in

1555
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:16,258
the container

1556
01:17:18,566 --> 01:17:20,000
perception capterized

1557
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,100
yeah the thing is is I don't have very

1558
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,533
many points in perception anyways

1559
01:17:27,933 --> 01:17:30,300
Evrart it's to the left of Leo so he's over here

1560
01:17:34,133 --> 01:17:37,425
okay well I'm thinking of pausing here

1561
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:38,900
one because

1562
01:17:39,766 --> 01:17:42,617
I can tell that my brain rot is developing

1563
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:43,600
 and also

1564
01:17:44,591 --> 01:17:47,658
this will make a good starting point for their next stream

1565
01:17:48,566 --> 01:17:49,799
yeah we're going to stop here

1566
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:53,666
 one because where chat is currently being overridden with bots 

1567
01:17:53,933 --> 01:17:57,566
and I would like to cleanse all of them immediately

1568
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:00,166
it's a little distracting and also

1569
01:18:00,366 --> 01:18:03,100
I've been streaming for almost 6 hours and this

1570
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:05,166
this is where brainrot settles in and

1571
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,775
I no longer have anything coherent to say

1572
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:12,466
yeah I did say I was gonna stream disco for one hour

1573
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:13,266
didn't I

1574
01:18:14,566 --> 01:18:16,066
well that didn't succeed

1575
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,166
I've been streaming disco for almost three hours now

1576
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:20,166
what can I say

1577
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,333
it's a great fucking game and

1578
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,333
I feel like this time we actually

1579
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:28,066
made a decent little bit of progress in the narrative 

1580
01:18:28,933 --> 01:18:30,200
