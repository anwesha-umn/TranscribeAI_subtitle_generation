1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:01,066
hello

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,133
and welcome back to our therapist plays Disco Elysium

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,200
let's play if you're new here

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
hello my name is Brady

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,933
I'm a therapist

6
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,100
and we're doing kind of like a long forum

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,333
psychoanalysis of our main character

8
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,607
and all of the people that we meet in

9
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:21,166
our twisted weird journey through Revachol in Disco Elysium

10
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,200
so on today's episode we're kind of getting

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,760
deeper into the analysis

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,472
and actually kind of targeting our companion Kim

13
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:32,218
who at least in my play through

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,581
and the way I'm sort of role playing this character

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,360
we don't have like the most trusting relationship with yet and 

16
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,566
kind of getting into the psychology of like

17
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,733
what does it mean to

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,800
want to trust someone

19
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,130
but not be sure if you can yet

20
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,400
and how does

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,200
someone who has a lot of like prior trauma

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,133
like our main character does

23
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:57,100
actually evaluate whether or not someone

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,472
who promises to be there on your side

25
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:02,930
is actually trustworthy in what they say

26
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,266
so today I'm going to give you

27
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,829
kind of a mix of psychological theory behind this idea

28
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:07,621
and also

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,290
how I would actually address something like this

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,283
in practice as a therapist

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,660
so with that is

32
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:14,760
let's continue

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,300
so

34
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,680
what do I need to do

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,789
I need to ask okay I need to solve this murder

36
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:29,560
I gotta be honest like the

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,472
the murder is like the lowest priority thing

38
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:34,167
to my character right now

39
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:38,618
I genuinely believe that if I'm this character

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,629
the murder is just a vehicle

41
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,912
to discover more about who I was

42
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,730
and in that process

43
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:50,460
reckoning with the idea that I may have done something

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,807
to myself to try to forget that person

45
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:53,890
and here I'm spending a lot of time

46
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,265
trying to figure that out

47
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,781
I could go do

48
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:04,766
I can go do the autopsy

49
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,566
I have the gloves and I have the form

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,003
maybe I should do that

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,566
the size of it to do list

52
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,000
I know I'm just collecting tasks

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,392
jam mystery

54
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,261
I kind of want to go see the body

55
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,861
let's do the autopsy real quick

56
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,723
I have all the ingredients I need

57
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:34,930
let's see what happens

58
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:45,250
maybe it will tell us something provide us information 

59
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,458
the rotting man lies on his side 

60
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,396
with his eyes looking straight through you

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,260
the belt is still around his neck

62
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:59,200
his body is supplying and open to intrusion by autopsy

63
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,043
Let's do it

64
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:03,985
the lieutenant adjusts his glasses and takes a deep breath

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,200
what is a *field autopsy*

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
come on officer

67
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,200
you know what a field autopsy is

68
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,866
you've done a hundred of them

69
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:14,341
let's get in there

70
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:16,341
there truly is a time for everything

71
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,466
even for yellow gardening gloves

72
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,066
however they are lacking hygienically

73
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,300
I suggest you *get in there* in limited capacity

74
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,201
I mean when I need you to

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,181
until then I should handle physical contact

76
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:31,767
and you should take notes

77
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,069
okay

78
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:34,600
I'm agreeable to this

79
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,900
this is collaborative

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,327
we're setting clear roles for each other that's okay

81
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:39,930
I don't need to be in control all the time

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
that's right

83
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:45,300
you *knew* it because you inspected your ledger

84
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:48,400
the lieutenant is relieved you know the protocol

85
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:50,600
okay a little bit of trust building 

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,530
"open your ledger at the field autopsy form"

87
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,166
let's follow this

88
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,600
the dead man stares in silence as you crack open the Ledger

89
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:03,900
the bright red paper is covered in boxes and lists

90
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:07,133
describing the condition of his skin and organs

91
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,566
in three parts

92
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:09,060
okay

93
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:09,966
above those

94
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:13,733
an eleven field info form needs filling out first

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,100
it begins with

96
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,133
"assistant"

97
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,866
the corpse is indifferent to your scribblings

98
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,333
just lies there

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,400
the next box says

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,618
"coroner's case number"

101
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,158
KK57

102
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:31,002
 dash

103
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:33,377
 0803

104
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:34,145
 dot

105
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:36,193
 0815 

106
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,160
write it down

107
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,898
N/A next

108
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:40,533
 N/A

109
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,566
roughly 50

110
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,333
the corpse looks ageless like meat on a hook

111
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,933
teeming with opportunistic microorganisms

112
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:54,266
letting out of foul-smelling diamine compound

113
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,425
your eyes turn watery

114
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,425
Mondial

115
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:00,829
Mondial

116
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,506
the pudgy mess of curdled meat

117
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:07,950
 looks neither *Mondial* nor anything other

118
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,000
looks neither *Mondial* nor anything other

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
fucky-fucky

120
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,733
forgot she was there

121
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,576
male

122
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,600
pigs gonna have sex

123
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,066
all right I'll

124
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,533
nor does he look male

125
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:26,900
with his pregnant belly and indistinguishable face

126
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:30,730
we're still going with March 4th 51

127
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,100
what else

128
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:36,660
nine *body identified by* is non applicable

129
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:41,229
*10 case number* is the same as the coroner's case

130
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:48,356
KK57-0503-0815

131
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,660
listens motionless

132
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,240
with the cargo belt still around his neck

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,165
"evidence of treatment"

134
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,760
none at least not after the initial examination

135
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,130
a strange word *treatment*

136
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,866
"what exactly *is* treatment anyway"

137
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:12,066
interfering with the body's position or wounds postmortem

138
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,500
I mean I did hit him with a crowbar

139
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,700
aren't you a *cop*

140
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,866
you're leaving a weak impression here

141
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,912
say something sure handed

142
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:24,647
oh shit I'm losing I'm losing respect again

143
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,054
it's okay to be unsure

144
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,290
my mental states are in competition once again okay

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,300
is it okay to be unsure

146
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,933
I mean I've pretty much been that this entire time

147
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,400
and Kim hasn't abandoned me yet

148
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,166
in fact there's some security in it

149
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,366
he could have been

150
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,290
what if he was dead before they hanged him

151
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,366
they'd *have* to have incapacitated and carried him over

152
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,200
this men was more than a match

153
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,766
foreign trained dockworkers

154
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,900
your central nervous system recognizes this gesture

155
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:07,400
it's the *stations of the breath*

156
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:10,366
ecclesiastic religious in nature

157
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:13,400
a holdout from pre-dolorian burial rites

158
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,066
it takes him two seconds to perform

159
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:17,166
then

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
somewhere in Jamrock North

161
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,566
a small wood shed behind Rozenkrantz Row

162
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,700
lieutenant Nick Feuerbach

163
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,766
puts his hand to the chest of a small corpse

164
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,400
no larger than a monkey

165
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,200
it's raining outside light drizzle

166
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,133
there is darkness in the shed

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,500
elsewhere yet an obese female sits in a wicker chair

168
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,000
her silhouette ball-like against the window

169
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,766
outside Grand Couron

170
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:48,066
the day is turning dim for Sergeant Mack Torson

171
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,938
hand extended he approaches

172
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,912
to make sure she is dead more than anything else

173
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,603
this game has such a way of painting a picture

174
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:57,774
it's gorgeous

175
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,360
the building is tall

176
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:02,500
seven stories wind-wrapped in solitude

177
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,500
most of the apartments are unoccupied

178
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:06,966
this was a suicide

179
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,200
the other an accident

180
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,566
the small one

181
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:15,927
and so all across Jamrock Coal City G.R.I.H

182
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,000
42 deceased persons found today

183
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,258
42 stations of breath

184
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,333
we should start to postmortem

185
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,266
the corpse cannot feel Kim's hand on his chest

186
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:34,300
it no longer meaningfully interacts with its surroundings 

187
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:38,000
a thicket of boxes and lists on red copier paper

188
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,900
tries to answer "why"

189
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:45,133
"external examination summary"

190
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,109
let's do that

191
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,330
the deceased wears armoured boots and white briefs

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,300
the make of the briefs is babroudine I think

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,800
let's see

194
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:56,900
C it's happening

195
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,700
babroudine yes inexpensive

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,766
size M color white

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,300
the disappointment is palpable

198
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,966
the red haired thing was expecting something (more lurid)

199
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,366
the boots are ceramic

200
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,000
vitreous enamel

201
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,066
they're fused to his skin from blood flowing donward postmortem

202
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,666
removal of the boots is left for processing

203
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,792
I still want them

204
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:24,700
after the autopsy before the body is taken away

205
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,733
there will be a *window* of opportunity

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,266
after the lieutenant has gone to sleep

207
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,600
I hope this has helped you my liege

208
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:33,800
my liege

209
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,733
I like drama

210
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,541
drama is putting me in a position of authority

211
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,200
tattoos

212
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,366
the upper torso is covered in a single continuous tattoo

213
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,300
resembling a national patern

214
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:50,600
it reaches from the right shoulder to the heart

215
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,366
the ink is blue and white

216
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,666
the assistant has a colour photograph of the markings

217
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,866
to be added to the case files as document A1

218
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,466
the photo is taken on the scene using a Triggat Mini

219
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,066
the deceased has a cargo lashing belt around his neck

220
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,766
tied with a hangman's knot

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,333
colour yellow length 3 meters

222
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,166
there is a buckle on the other hand

223
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:17,766
well nourished athletically built measuring 1.80 meters

224
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:20,766
generally consistent with age about 50

225
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,500
preservation is good

226
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
ambient temperature below freezing

227
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,360
so if I'm imagining like psycho-dynamically

228
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,650
what is my character thinking as

229
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,200
he watches Kim do this right

230
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm developing a framework for

231
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,260
what an effective cop looks like

232
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,300
and I am very quickly realizing that it's not me

233
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
like my character is stupid

234
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,660
look at how my intellect measures up like

235
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,020
there's no way I would be able to deduce any of that stuff

236
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,780
and so a character in this position

237
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,640
may start feeling like

238
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,390
both feelings of inferiority but also dependence on Kim

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,800
right

240
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm gonna start feeling like okay well

241
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,200
there's a part of me that

242
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,900
trusts that as long as I'm with Kim

243
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,870
I don't need to learn these things

244
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,330
so there is some security and uncertainty

245
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,122
but at the same time I would also feel like

246
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,300
like empty of critical thought with Kim not around

247
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,100
body hair is light brown

248
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,400
distribution is consistent with age

249
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,060
the deceased had male pattern baldness

250
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,000
hair is combed back short

251
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,200
lividity is consistent with hanging

252
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,960
the head is congested

253
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,530
contrusions are present on the head chest and thighs

254
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,600
consistent with stones thrown postmortem low velocity

255
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,600
fucking low velocity

256
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,160
you think Cuno doesn't know what you're talking about

257
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,000
velocity was fucking Max

258
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,500
talking shit about Cuno's velocity

259
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,260
in addition

260
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,530
there are bitemarks on the face scalp and chest

261
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,400
consistent with predation

262
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,600
write it down but amend for high velocity

263
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,100
it's all for Cuno

264
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,460
well I'll find another way to please Cuno 

265
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,940
small folding knife

266
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,900
with the other hand pulling on the belt

267
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,400
he starts cutting into the polyester

268
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,360
the stench is horrid

269
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,660
after a while it's obvious the material cannot be cut

270
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,730
there's too much of it

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
we need to remove the belt

272
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,330
so we can get to the ligature mark

273
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,760
you got just the right tool for that

274
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,960
oh yes I'm prepared

275
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,060
the handman lets out

276
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,330
a joints little bubble of rot from his nose

277
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,060
always good to think ahead

278
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,130
now

279
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,130
look at all this shit

280
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,360
I just collected all this shit

281
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,880
and I'm fully assembled the kit that I need to solve this crime

282
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,300
let's go

283
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,160
we need to cut the belt to see the lgature mark below

284
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,000
carefully with as much precision as you can

285
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
see my pig is gonna fuck his head off

286
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,560
no he ain't your pigs are boring fuck

287
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,530
hey I could I could submit to the Cuno this time

288
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,930
look for a good spot first

289
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,960
the belt is equally tight

290
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,460
around the whole circumference of his neck

291
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,500
swelling over the edges like white bread

292
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,200
rising from the yeast

293
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,860
I mean what do I lose if I say this

294
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,900
I might as well

295
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,930
gain some ground with Cuno while I'm here

296
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,560
you are this pig is Cuno's

297
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,260
yeah

298
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,960
being Cuno's pig has a steadying effect on your hand

299
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,760
go with the flow man

300
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,760
yes

301
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,590
yes I increased my chance since let's go

302
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,200
hey look

303
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,160
things work out when you submit to the Cuno

304
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
roll the fucking dice

305
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
after some deliberation

306
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,300
let's go

307
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,140
thank you Cuno

308
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,930
you squeeze the rubber handles together

309
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,360
sweat forming on your brow

310
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,300
the knot is slashed

311
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,200
another cut

312
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,000
and the belt falls apart like a flower bouquet

313
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,200
revealing the dead man's neck

314
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,300
and the dark red ligature mark around it

315
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,760
here's the thing okay

316
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,730
I don't have to actually believe that

317
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,960
all I know is that I was able to manipulate that kid

318
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,000
into giving me a self esteem boost

319
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,530
I don't have to actually believe I'm his pig

320
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,200
the rope rises to a point

321
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,060
leaving a gap in the ligature mark

322
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,000
the suspension point is in the back of the neck

323
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,600
as it ought to

324
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,600
this is where its grip on the curdled meat is gentlest

325
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,900
pulling up

326
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,100
haemorrhaging is observed on the skin

327
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,200
above and below the ligature mark

328
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,000
the mark is well pronounced

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,760
consistent with a drop from 1 or 1.5 meters

330
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,730
write it down

331
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,330
normal contour

332
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,660
abdomen is protuberant pelvis intact genitalia

333
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,960
now it's gonna happen C

334
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,620
Cuno

335
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,060
this is clearly what they've been waiting for

336
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,400
ever since the autopsy began

337
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,930
the lieutenant is trying to make it as boring as possible

338
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
and look

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,730
Kim is gonna miss out on his Cuno bonus okay

340
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,760
you need to hype these kids up it will steady your hand

341
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600
genitalia is male and unremarkable

342
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,400
no evidence of injury

343
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,060
let's get an inspection on them ourselves

344
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,900
the dead man's penis is average sized

345
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,000
congested from the downward collection of blood

346
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,300
the testicles are uneven in length hanging underneath

347
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,560
the genitalia is greenish

348
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,130
marbling is present around the crotch

349
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,400
way more descriptive than I needed

350
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,530
you should touch it

351
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
uh let's let's inquire further

352
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,500
ah yes your hunch before

353
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,930
we can have a semen analysis requested from processing

354
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,100
if that's what you meant

355
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,690
I'm trying to get a psychic read yeah let's uh

356
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,960
not you weren't officer

357
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,500
that would be preposterous

358
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,860
just write down

359
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,800
that we request a semen vegidal and anal fluids and analysis

360
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,700
the corpse with his pants down

361
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,960
does not have an opinion on the subject

362
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,330
all he has is genitals and a deathly odour

363
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,000
look if it entertains the Cuno

364
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,530
doesn't feel like anything

365
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,660
a cold spot under your gardening gloves

366
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,500
unremarkable and unalive

367
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,200
my pig's so fucking ill right now

368
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,730
see I told you

369
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,060
it's just all to win back favor with the Cuno

370
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
ya pig's pretty sick I gotta say

371
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,360
this wasn't necessary

372
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,160
what's going on here

373
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,700
why are you doing that

374
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,900
I I am detecting

375
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,260
yeah how can they not understand

376
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,780
I am trying to right my wrongs with Cuno

377
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,200
because he represents my fractured child self

378
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
and Kims as well

379
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,563
okay Cuno is the most important character in this whole fucking game 

380
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:36,200
so far

381
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,963
 like he represents the outcome of this society

382
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,663
like you want to talk about politics

383
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:42,830
you want to talk about the economy

384
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,496
you want to talk about mental health

385
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:48,696
okay well we could talk in circles about the abstract

386
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:50,296
connection between these things

387
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:53,263
but the result of all of these things being

388
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:55,763
broken is right here in front of us okay

389
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:58,763
it's a child born in this world

390
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:01,530
and the kinds of things that he has to deal with

391
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,163
in the worldview that he has

392
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,296
like he is the culmination of this entire society and

393
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,463
the way that people coalesce around ideas

394
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:14,630
like Cuno represents everything okay

395
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,663
what am I doing if I'm not trying to help him in some small way

396
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:23,930
the lieutenant is unaware of what's happening in your head

397
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,530
and why you're touching it

398
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,463
he merely expects you to write down his notes on the man's genitalia

399
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:31,896
so you can move on

400
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,296
write it down

401
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:35,296
back is symmetrical and intact

402
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:37,696
upper and lower extremities are intact

403
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,063
but asymmetrical

404
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,096
there are all combat injuries on the right hand thigh and hip

405
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:45,863
all roads lead to Cuno okay

406
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,696
if we're gonna do anything productive in this play through

407
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:50,530
we are going to heal Cuno

408
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,330
thus we will heal ourselves

409
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,763
bullets have bitten little pieces out of him

410
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,563
it must have been excruciating

411
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,030
especially the hip

412
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:05,096
before you is a temple of pain that knew little tenderness in life

413
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:09,863
in addition I see smaller residual scars

414
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:11,063
too numerous to count

415
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:13,863
covering about 30 percent of his skin

416
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:15,496
should I interpret that

417
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,130
we have a real museum here

418
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:20,230
battles wars

419
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,163
yeah well how would I know that

420
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:27,030
if I didn't make some physical contact of my own

421
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,030
last item hands

422
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:32,330
hands you say let's pick up that hand

423
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,130
his flesh is cold icy

424
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:36,863
pleased to meet you

425
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:39,563
where are you from and what's your name

426
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,496
my name is Raphael Ambrosius Costeau

427
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:48,063
I'm only fucking with you

428
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:50,296
I know where you're from

429
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,696
from Coppodocia

430
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,330
and your name

431
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,463
is Il Cobo

432
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,030
what can I do you for

433
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,730
Il Cobo di Coppodocia

434
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,296
are you a temple of pain and a stranger to tenderness

435
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,430
God damn

436
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:09,830
we've met before

437
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,530
I've touched your genitals

438
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,296
you get me Cobo

439
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:21,363
I feel like you were once for tenderness and kisses yourself

440
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:23,130
but then shit went south

441
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,230
and now you're ahead of even me on the pain front

442
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,563
we should do this more often

443
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,863
be close like this I mean

444
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,163
I agree

445
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:34,563
no sign of injury from struggling

446
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:37,696
were we expecting any

447
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:39,830
maybe I'm just not seeing them

448
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,163
honestly this tension is making it hard

449
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:43,363
for me to think at the moment

450
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:44,230
jot that down

451
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:47,863
that's all for the external

452
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:49,963
well done what next

453
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,496
external examination completes

454
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:57,330
let's do an eternal examination

455
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,463
central nervous system

456
00:20:58,763 --> 00:20:59,830
I have nothing

457
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,830
do you have anything on this man's central nervous system

458
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,530
uh well I

459
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,930
would say that we're gonna see

460
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,430
lots of things in the autonomic nervous system out of regulation

461
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,863
you don't even have a joke

462
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,163
fuck my guys too stupid

463
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:28,130
muscoskeletal

464
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:30,930
church fluid is coming from the mouth

465
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:32,630
not injury related

466
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,763
eyes ans tongue protuberant

467
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,163
hyoid bone let's see

468
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,296
with his eyes almost closed

469
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:43,530
the lieutenant puts his hand on a dead man's throat

470
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,096
and begins to massage it gently

471
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,963
a rotting smell erupts from the mouth

472
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,463
purge fluid runs down his lips black and viscous

473
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,130
yeah jack that fucker off

474
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,830
the hyoid bone is fractured

475
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,830
the rest of the muscoskeletal system is intact

476
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,130
unremarkable

477
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:05,663
write it down

478
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:06,930
respiratory system

479
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,863
begins to pry open the dead man's jaws

480
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,030
he stops to exert more force both hands are used

481
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,163
oral cavity shows no lesions

482
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,963
the victim has received dental implants

483
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,563
possibly after a combat wound

484
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,263
mouth swollen

485
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:25,463
hemorrhaging present in mucosa of the lips and mouth

486
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:26,530
from here

487
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,496
it looks as though the clown faced man is screaming

488
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:32,263
the tendons of his jaw are torn apart

489
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:36,363
hyoid ripped from the force of the lieutenant's hands

490
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:38,296
let's get a scope on that guy's mouth

491
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:39,363
no scream

492
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:42,896
no sigh of relief rises from the darkness inside

493
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,730
it's humid there

494
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,063
sickly sweet air unlike anything living

495
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:52,330
you feel like throwing up straight in that mouth

496
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,163
I feel like throwing up in his mouth

497
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:56,730
no you don't you can keep it in

498
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,896
you can keep anything

499
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,330
yes yes I can

500
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,730
you manage to suppress the contractions 

501
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,430
trying to empty your stomach

502
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,863
all it takes is concentration

503
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:13,363
through it you see nothing but more meat and darkness

504
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,863
there are ancient mysteries down there Cobo

505
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,230
ask me later

506
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:24,096
okay

507
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:26,030
hepatobiliary present in mucous

508
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:29,830
right it down

509
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,463
hepatobiliary N/A

510
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,663
are you hepatobiliary expert

511
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,963
no

512
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:36,763
neither am I

513
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:37,863
that's it

514
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:40,863
same for toxicology and serology N/A

515
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:41,230
alright 

516
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,996
cardiovascular

517
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:45,630
the body exhibits lividity in the lower extremities

518
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,696
feet hands and neck

519
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:49,563
visually consistent with the hanging

520
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:50,763
just write down

521
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:56,363
digested semisolid food in stomach

522
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,330
voilà

523
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:01,830
let's keep the voilà

524
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,230
what's next on the list

525
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:05,430
description of injuries

526
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,030
we have bite marks

527
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,630
contrusions on the head and chest

528
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,230
and the ligatory Mark encircling in the neck

529
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:13,163
you'll need three fields

530
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:14,730
leave a fourth one too

531
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,163
all right let's check out those bite marks

532
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,930
head chest and scalp bite mark injuries

533
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:21,930
predation by birds has caused damage to the body

534
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:24,630
autontologies does not need to be consulted

535
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,463
write down your opinion

536
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,963
(and) your opinion officer

537
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:30,263
oh he's asking me my opinion

538
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,263
okay Kim

539
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,063
giving me control back here

540
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:39,063
fatal injury by seagulls

541
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:42,963
okay it's not a fatal injury then

542
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:47,463
that's right what's next

543
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,830
okay I feel that

544
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,296
(so) the scalp bleeds from a postmotem had injury

545
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:52,930
a stone

546
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,363
the injury does not have the rim of an early inflammatory response

547
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,163
a perpetrator on the scene has confessed to causing its postmortem

548
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:03,430
that's a lot of writing for my guy to do

549
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:07,230
has confessed to causing it at maximum velocity

550
00:25:08,763 --> 00:25:09,363
look at that

551
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:12,663
even Kim is getting on board with the with the Cuno

552
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:15,630
look if you make Cuno happy things work out

553
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,763
coagulated blood sticks to his scalp and chest

554
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,063
where the countless stones have hit the dead man

555
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:25,963
beneath the description of injury two boxes

556
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,263
nonfatal

557
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:29,063
right

558
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:30,030
next

559
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,263
ligature mark

560
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,430
oh what's the fourth for

561
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:34,463
just in case

562
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:35,330
okay

563
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,463
(a)dark red the braided ligature mark encircling the neck

564
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,530
with a gap on the nape measuring

565
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,496
let's say 7 centimetres

566
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:44,330
the hyoid bone is fractured

567
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:46,163
the cervical column intact

568
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,096
I see hemorrhaging on the skin

569
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,130
above and below the ligature mark

570
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,030
depth of the mark 1 centimetre

571
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,096
no signs of clothing on the neck

572
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:55,963
what was that

573
00:25:58,496 --> 00:25:59,563
sort of breakthrough

574
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:00,363
what was that

575
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,730
on this

576
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,163
breakthrough imminent

577
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:11,763
do I need to do anything for this

578
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:15,163
guess not

579
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,930
just wait

580
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,530
below the note two customary boxes wait to be ticked

581
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:27,363
the man's head jerks to the side

582
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:30,363
the ring around his neck is visible

583
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,963
that's it we have established cause of death

584
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:38,963
it's not much and it leaves much to be questioned

585
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,296
but it's a start

586
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,496
let's wrab this up

587
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,696
I pronounced this philodepsy over

588
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,430
let's do a deep breath

589
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:48,430
let's ask him how it went

590
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,263
well we established probable cause of death

591
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:53,463
some would say that's the goal of an autopsy

592
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:57,930
we requested a test to be run on the genitals that was de règle

593
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:01,030
the results should arrive in a couple of weeks if we are lucky

594
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,563
I will not hold my breath

595
00:27:02,563 --> 00:27:05,030
we were comfortable with the list of injuries too

596
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,963
we described them all in detail

597
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:08,296
what is there to say

598
00:27:08,763 --> 00:27:10,296
given the circumstances

599
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,330
it was a professional field autopsy

600
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:15,830
oh yeah well done master detective

601
00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:18,363
maybe a drink is in order

602
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:20,763
maybe it is

603
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,930
now you see that worries me

604
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,763
you will die if you drink

605
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:26,030
you know that don't you

606
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,230
you are proving a useful detective

607
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,130
the organization would miss you

608
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,563
oh of such sweet words

609
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:35,730
coated and mistrust

610
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,030
please get yourself together

611
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:42,130
the lieutenant from Precinct 57 thinks

612
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:43,896
all right

613
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,263
we'll drink later we won't tell him

614
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:47,463
we won't invite him

615
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:48,830
we'll drink with Cuno

616
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,063
I need a copy of that autopsy form

617
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,263
then I will drive him to Faubourg (for processing)

618
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,330
there you go

619
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,296
he's thinking

620
00:27:58,863 --> 00:27:59,963
did I miss something

621
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,863
perception legendary

622
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:12,263
you know I have to try this 3%

623
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,063
I can't resist it

624
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:16,863
let's see if I can ask him

625
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,863
shoot loonie roonie

626
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:24,696
love or communism

627
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,930
don't even I have to

628
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:30,663
you said love to kill you

629
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:32,563
but when you fell down you said it was communism

630
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:34,530
you're misquoting me Roonie

631
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,863
I said communism killed me

632
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:39,296
love

633
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:40,863
did me in

634
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:46,363
ancient mysteries

635
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:48,063
Gobo mi Lobo

636
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,296
in the gift horses mouth

637
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,363
tracts and wakes and waterways

638
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:58,530
ancient materials buried

639
00:28:58,663 --> 00:28:59,630
but to where brother

640
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,930
just a small gulp away

641
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:04,630
my beloved gobo

642
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,163
a small gope away

643
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,696
he wants me to get drunk

644
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:11,330
the blue heart

645
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:12,296
blue

646
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:14,930
that's good shit

647
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,896
you'll love it

648
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:19,263
just press down

649
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:23,430
and fuck it open like you always do

650
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,363
oh my God

651
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,763
fuck it hard 

652
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:31,063
copopo the clown

653
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:34,963
he means force it'll work

654
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:38,163
come back later coppo

655
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:41,863
amuse yourself with my frank manners

656
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,330
and my mementor mori features

657
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:52,830
if possible also see me in your dream

658
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,330
this is a perception check

659
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:04,963
okay perception has historically not gone very well for me

660
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:08,696
where is perception

661
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,530
it takes in the final detail of the physical world

662
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:24,963
you're going to miss out on everything with low levels

663
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:26,663
you can't arrest what you can't see

664
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:31,296
I have a pretty low level should I level it up before I try this

665
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,896
or should I just go for the 3 percente

666
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,896
I'll just go for the 3 percente fuck it

667
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,763
you run your hands over the victim's cold body

668
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:45,330
his limbs his torso with its swollen organs

669
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,230
maybe you should be more thorough

670
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,663
I wasn't actually that bad though

671
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:56,730
I was pretty close

672
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:02,563
let's check out

673
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,230
the genitals in his breeches

674
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,263
continue to be unnoteworthy

675
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:08,863
you see the penis of a dead man

676
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:13,163
if you've seen it once you've already got the picture

677
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:16,163
I mean

678
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,096
what's the harm in trying it again

679
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:19,063
there is no need

680
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,563
we have been through with the genitals

681
00:31:22,896 --> 00:31:24,963
you know what Kim this actually isn't about you

682
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:26,530
you can't shake the feeling that

683
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,863
there are more secrets concealed in the flesh before(you)

684
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:31,663
yes yes there's more

685
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:33,096
okay well

686
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,963
we're in livor mortis here

687
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,630
he is disintegrating

688
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,863
we need to refrigerate the body

689
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,030
we want to conduct another examination

690
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,430
and we need to do it fast

691
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:47,496
if you want for this task to slowly become impossible

692
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:48,630
then yes

693
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,730
otherwise no

694
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,896
he's been hanging out far too long already

695
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:54,496
we need to ice him

696
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,696
not to mention the damage that

697
00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:58,963
would be dealt to the force's reputation

698
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:00,463
by the corpse just rotting here(like this)

699
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:02,196
okay okay where do we find a fridge

700
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:04,430
(it would have to be)industrial in size

701
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,563
let's start by asking Garte at the whirling-in-rags

702
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,363
and the Frittte store down at the gates

703
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:11,763
if they don't know

704
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:15,263
but only if all else fails

705
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,663
maybe Cuno knows

706
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,363
you want a piece of the Cuno

707
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:21,830
want to get fucked

708
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,363
I would like a piece of the Cuno

709
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:24,830
only if all else fails

710
00:32:26,063 --> 00:32:26,696
hurry

711
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,630
this is one task we cannot sideline

712
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,863
with every hour

713
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:31,863
whatever we are looking for will become (harder to find)

714
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:33,663
okay this is just become urgent

715
00:32:33,696 --> 00:32:37,230
you'll be looking for clues in a pile of sludge and bones

716
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,463
yeah I can't check this one again

717
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,430
okay let's bag him

718
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,363
if you think so officer

719
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,063
I'm not going to object

720
00:32:48,363 --> 00:32:49,296
I need a little help

721
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:51,930
for carrying him to the holding pen of my Kineema

722
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,063
I'll take it from there

723
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:56,230
there go those beautiful enamel boots

724
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,496
may they rest in processing

725
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,430
it's too late to take him into processing today

726
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,296
I'll take him first thing tomorrow

727
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:09,263
okay

728
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:12,830
well we missed our opportunity

729
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:13,863
that's all right

730
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,263
I'm over it

731
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,163
Ace's High

732
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,363
oh what is this

733
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,130
for the rest of the world

734
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:29,930
the Ace's High is just a cool Rivershore thing

735
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,530
politically neutral

736
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:35,563
in Revershol it still holds revolutionary connotations

737
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:39,163
also have you looked at Lieutenant Kitsuragi's clothes

738
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,030
he wears a bomber jacket

739
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,530
just like the ones worn by aerostatic brigades 

740
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,930
and those cargo pants

741
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,130
could store tools for hot fixing your aerostatic

742
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:51,430
maybe you should ask him about this

743
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,863
could get some empathy could get some

744
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,263
some know how about the roots

745
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,930
looks like we're going to talk to Kim now

746
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,330
let's get Kim's opinion on where we're at with things

747
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:11,263
yes

748
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:17,930
want to talk about you

749
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,430
so this is where this is where my original thought

750
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,463
is probably gonna come into play right

751
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,430
like I've talked about how

752
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,530
it's hard to trust people when you are

753
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:36,430
someone who has historically not been cared for looked after

754
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,696
or sympathized with right

755
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,296
that's like where trust issues generally tend to

756
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:44,696
manifest in new relationships right

757
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,696
the reason I'm going around

758
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:49,496
with Kim is because we both have the same

759
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:52,230
job same objective

760
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,430
and he hasn't presented as immediately hostile to me

761
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:57,763
but that's almost even more

762
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,563
suspicious from my character's point of view because

763
00:35:01,096 --> 00:35:02,830
someone who's immediately hostile

764
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,330
or immediately defensive like confirms my worldview

765
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:09,463
but Kim challenges it because he tells me he's on our side

766
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:10,463
and yet

767
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:14,263
I'm still wondering like why

768
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:16,763
why would you be on my side I've done nothing

769
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:20,663
I've done nothing to trade for that level of empathy

770
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:25,730
but here we are getting an opportunity to do that right

771
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,763
I now want to figure out what

772
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,463
what makes him

773
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,296
want to stand beside me

774
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,030
me

775
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:36,363
yes you

776
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,763
(I don't see how) my life is pertinent to the investigation

777
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,130
Kim your life is

778
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,963
the most important thing to this investigation okay

779
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:45,696
our relationship is the key to solving everything

780
00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:49,030
work better together if we have more rapport hmm

781
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,263
that's a fair point

782
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:54,096
all right for the good of the investigation

783
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,263
what do you want to know

784
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,263
you don't look like other people around here

785
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:10,096
okay

786
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,163
I think there's something else I want to explain

787
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:17,199
before I continue with this dialog

788
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,566
pull up my whiteboard here

789
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,733
so I'm gonna give you a bit of an insight about

790
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,600
what the therapeutic line of questioning often looks like 

791
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,966
and why this

792
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,178
the kind of dialogue that I'm gonna have with Kim 

793
00:36:39,178 --> 00:36:41,000
 going forward is probably gonna be really important

794
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,200
so like

795
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:46,600
in the process of therapy right

796
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,733
 we can imagine a

797
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:53,100
therapy session looking something like this let's say

798
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,100
and if this is over time

799
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:03,600
and this is like the amount of anxiety that someone has

800
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:12,500
this is gonna look pretty different person to person 

801
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,933
but generally let's say we start a session off 

802
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,266
and the person I'm talking to

803
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:24,730
has very low anxiety

804
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,300
 they're talking about things

805
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,866
they're sharing personal history they're talking about

806
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,566
stressful events but

807
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,533
their anxiety is not very high

808
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,200
what they're essentially doing is like

809
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,700
speaking about things in a very intellectual way

810
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,733
they're saying yeah

811
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,700
my partner broke up with me

812
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:45,500
yeah I'm really upset you know that

813
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,366
there's racist people in the world I don't know right

814
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,333
they're talking but their anxiety is very low okay

815
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:57,166
this is not extremely productive for a therapy session right 

816
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,566
we're essentially just having a conversation down here

817
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:02,266
there's a very different kind of therapy session

818
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:03,733
where I start asking questions

819
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,266
there's a lot of anxiety right

820
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,600
the person's anxiety immediately goes up

821
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,000
when I start asking like

822
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,066
how are you feeling today right

823
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:16,733
and so the difference between someone who is down here

824
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,166
and someone who is maybe up here right is

825
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,333
this I would call

826
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,133
intellectualizing

827
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,933
and this I would call being in a crisis

828
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,866
and so we have two very different like experiences and 

829
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:51,933
sometimes you know the level of anxiety can kind of 

830
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,400
fluctuate throughout a session

831
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,666
but the most beneficial psychological work

832
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:06,730
tends to happen in a space somewhere in the midst of

833
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,266
being in a crisis and intellectualizing right

834
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,366
and this is a space that I'm going to call like the

835
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:23,366
psychological work zone 

836
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,999
essentially what I'm trying to do  

837
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,311
is I'm trying to get someone to experience 

838
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:34,733
a little bit of anxiety as they're talking about things

839
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:35,533
because

840
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:38,166
I don't just want you to tell me what was wrong

841
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:41,900
I want you to be feeling that wrong emotion 

842
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,866
while you're talking about it because

843
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,066
that's where the processing happens

844
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,966
that's where we're actually able to identify

845
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:52,000
maybe displaced emotions

846
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,900
that's where we're able to identify

847
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,795
what's coming up for you when your

848
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:58,500
competing mental states are causing tension right

849
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:02,100
 what we want is for someone to be in this zone

850
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,600
and so sometimes that does actually mean

851
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,366
like if I'm talking to someone and

852
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:07,500
they're just telling me

853
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:10,333
they're fine and they're doing okay and whatever

854
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:12,100
you're bored I'm bored

855
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,666
what I'm actually gonna try to do is

856
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,666
provoke you a little bit right

857
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:18,366
I'm actually gonna ask some questions that may like

858
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,066
confront your emotions and get you to feel

859
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,266
a little more tense right

860
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:26,166
I'm going to ask you something for example

861
00:40:26,366 --> 00:40:27,533
like this question

862
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:30,000
you don't look like other people around here

863
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,900
I'm trying to get him to get in touch 

864
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:37,733
with some of that resentment that we very rarely see from him 

865
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:41,166
but we see when he talks to the racist lorry driver

866
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:41,700
right

867
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,333
so I'm going to try to provoke his anxiety this way

868
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:50,100
and it's very often that people will try to avoid

869
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,666
feeling that way and bring their own anxiety down

870
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:55,133
they might say well that doesn't bother me

871
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,933
it's not a big deal right

872
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,966
let's move on

873
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,933
so this may be

874
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:05,166
a process of trying to provoke and provoke and provoke

875
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,724
until we get somewhere where 

876
00:41:06,724 --> 00:41:09,324
the person is actually able to get in touch with that feeling 

877
00:41:09,324 --> 00:41:10,100
 and say yeah

878
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,900
that really does bother me

879
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,666
okay now that you have the emotion in your hand and you're feeling it 

880
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,900
let's talk about it now that it's present right

881
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:20,400
you're not doing this anymore you're feeling it right

882
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:25,658
that's kind of the goal of some of that work 

883
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:29,866
 when there is some resistance to feeling something 

884
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,266
at the same time

885
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:34,933
I don't want to provoke them to a point where they

886
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,733
go into a crisis right because like

887
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,933
now I've pushed too hard and there's too much emotion

888
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,166
and this is actually the kind of person who

889
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,400
you know instead of provoking

890
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,987
I'm actually trying to console them and bring them down  

891
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:53,300
right like I'm gonna try to dial back 

892
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,733
the intensity of what we're talking about

893
00:41:57,133 --> 00:42:00,100
and that's kind of how I explain things to people

894
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:05,800
why I am trying to get a reaction out of 

895
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,355
the person I'm working with

896
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:12,400
it's not because I'm trying to piss them off

897
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,366
what I'm trying to do is to get them to feel

898
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,900
something they've become conditioned to avoid feeling right 

899
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,000
like we have all kinds of mental defenses

900
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,900
this is one of them right displacement to avoid feeling things 

901
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,766
and it's my job it's what I'm trained to do

902
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:32,100
to help you get into this zone where you can

903
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,333
experience a difficult emotion process it

904
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,466
work on it and then come back down

905
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,700
and at the same time

906
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,600
one of these is better than the other one

907
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:46,466
okay that's the real trick here

908
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,266
a lot of people might say well

909
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,900
intellectualizing sounds like the better one because

910
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,166
I mean this person has low anxiety right like that's

911
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,500
that's a good thing to

912
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,100
you know you know you don't have a lot of anxiety

913
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,566
that's good

914
00:42:58,566 --> 00:42:59,801
no one wants to have a lot of anxiety

915
00:42:59,801 --> 00:43:03,600
 this person you know who's in a crisis maybe all over the map 

916
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,466
but it's actually the opposite

917
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:10,566
I would actually much rather someone be in a crisis or 

918
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:14,100
maybe like all over the place

919
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:15,566
because

920
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:21,966
that person has actually crossed through this zone right 

921
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,133
the person who intellectualizes all the time

922
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:30,366
who spends all of their time not feeling any anxiety

923
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:34,300
but can talk at length about their anxiety like 

924
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:38,766
they can say that they have this trauma they can say they're upset 

925
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:41,268
they can tell you that they're very pissed off 

926
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:45,066
but they're not  feeling it as they talk about it 

927
00:43:45,066 --> 00:43:47,700
they're speaking about it in this way

928
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,400
that person has never experienced

929
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:53,533
being in the zone

930
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,500
and at least the person who is in crisis

931
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,766
has passed through that critical area

932
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:07,166
and just needs to like kind of focus that ability right 

933
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,500
what we want is for the person to learn how to

934
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:16,733
stabilize what they are feeling right

935
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:20,400
and spend enough time in this zone to where they can

936
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,100
they don't need to be provoked they can

937
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,900
reach this point process it and move on

938
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,166
without your guidance right

939
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,966
like my job as a therapist is to help

940
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:34,000
is to train you how to do this yourself basically

941
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,900
and so I always tell that to people like

942
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:40,666
we may think that intellectualizing is great

943
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,100
it's a great way to defend

944
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
against the uncomfortable feelings

945
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,766
but I would so much rather you be the person who is in a crisis 

946
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:51,471
who does not know how to manage their emotions 

947
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:55,800
because you've at least gotten close to what we're looking at

948
00:44:56,766 --> 00:45:00,300
so I'm going to have a conversation with Kim now

949
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:02,333
and my goal is to

950
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,300
provoke him a little bit 

951
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,733
and he's going to avoid that

952
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:09,166
he's going to try to

953
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,400
de-escalate the conversation and avoid getting to this point 

954
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,500
not to say that I'm doing therapy on him

955
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:18,333
I kind of am but

956
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:21,400
I essentially want to get him to a point where

957
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,600
he's a little bit

958
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,566
defenseless against the very raw emotions

959
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:31,066
because not only is it gonna tell us something about him 

960
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,066
it will probably

961
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:34,533
lead to him learning something about himself

962
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:36,100
as well right

963
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,500
you'll meet some characters you can't provoke

964
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,766
they have high defense well

965
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:50,566
I don't expect the lead detective to have the skills to do this with 

966
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,666
where everyone right

967
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,566
like I think that

968
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,719
only now as we learn something about Kim 

969
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,566
can we even start this process 

970
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,400
right

971
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:07,566
it's all about figuring out when to dial up the intensity 

972
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,266
to get people to talk about what you need to hear 

973
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,500
yeah and and like

974
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,800
I will always

975
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:16,666
inform the person once we're here like okay

976
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,100
you know I said some things

977
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,533
that confronted you on that and you really felt them

978
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:21,600
what was that like right

979
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,166
I'll always dial it back

980
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,500
and we'll get to a point where we do talk about it

981
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,665
like in a less intense way

982
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:28,766
 because I don't want

983
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,300
people to end the session feeling anxious

984
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,065
I want them to have experienced something 

985
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,866
important psychologically and worked through it

986
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:39,866
and then to come

987
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:42,400
back down here right

988
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:46,166
you thought my character was an ex therapist

989
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,000
well he is right and

990
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:53,333
that's something I'm trying to infuse with

991
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,600
the character which is like

992
00:46:56,966 --> 00:46:58,766
he knows how to do this stuff

993
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,000
he knows that

994
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,966
this is the way to get information from people

995
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:09,566
and he can't use his detective status against Kim 

996
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,100
because

997
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,500
Kim sees right through it

998
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,900
so I'm gonna provoke him

999
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:18,400
I'm gonna try to get him to that

1000
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,600
psychological work zone

1001
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,900
where we find more about him

1002
00:47:21,866 --> 00:47:24,400
that's because I'm a half-Seolite or quarter

1003
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
my father's father was from Seol

1004
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:27,841
so was my grandmother

1005
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:29,166
 but from my mother's side

1006
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:31,200
it's not an interesting topic

1007
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,100
it's not an interesting topic

1008
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,333
well how interesting

1009
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,733
that as I say that

1010
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,300
Kim

1011
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:43,333
I tried to provoke you a little bit that you

1012
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,400
retreat and you avoid and you withdraw okay

1013
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,166
let's see what happens

1014
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,066
it's a part of the world officer

1015
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,533
a geopolitical entity and a geographic division

1016
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,666
I told you it wouldn't be interesting

1017
00:48:00,466 --> 00:48:02,866
you're only making it sound uninteresting

1018
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,866
I still want to know more about Seol

1019
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:06,766
you're barking at the wrong tree

1020
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:08,866
I don't speak a word of seolite

1021
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:11,000
I've never met either one of my grandparents

1022
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,766
and I've never been to Seol

1023
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,933
I'm a regular Revacholiere

1024
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,932
this is the moment where if I have the opportunity 

1025
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:23,333
 I would come in here and say

1026
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:28,666
what is it like for you to not be in touch with your culture 

1027
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,266
what is it like for you to not be able to speak the language 

1028
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,300
that is a part of your upbringing 

1029
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:39,300
that you've never met either or your grandparents

1030
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,344
what is it like for you to

1031
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:45,333
present yourself as someone who cares a lot about your culture 

1032
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,800
but to have no real foundations for that 

1033
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:51,933
you're not convincing me right like

1034
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,900
these are some of the things that I might like

1035
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:57,800
try to process with him here

1036
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,366
I don't think that we're gonna get that dialogue option

1037
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:01,166
but

1038
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,300
hey Rex welcome

1039
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,533
welcome to the street Rex so good to see you here

1040
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:08,733
we gotta catch up soon

1041
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:11,933
he's glad to shut down your question

1042
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,900
yes okay empathy is coming in and

1043
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,133
letting me know that we're on the right track

1044
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:28,766
so where I think he is at right now is

1045
00:49:31,366 --> 00:49:34,600
I just pressed him and he avoided that

1046
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:41,166
he's not quite at the edge of this right 

1047
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:44,166
I wonder if we're gonna be

1048
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,366
able to push him a little bit more

1049
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:55,266
oh it does say I've never been to Seol

1050
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,733
and he seems almost proud of these things

1051
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,933
well I think it's a false sense of pride

1052
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:05,333
it's his way of avoiding that right because like

1053
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,800
look how direct he gets with me when he says

1054
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,300
you're barking up the wrong tree

1055
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,900
and he says it's a part of the world officer like

1056
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:19,166
we tend to add that ending on a statement like 

1057
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,533
it is what it is Brady

1058
00:50:21,566 --> 00:50:24,272
like we state someone's name when we are

1059
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:27,366
trying to make it clear to them and we're frustrated

1060
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:29,400
so like I think that him

1061
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,300
he says I'm a regular Revacholiere

1062
00:50:34,566 --> 00:50:37,286
is his way of avoiding the fact that  

1063
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:39,466
he actually does care about

1064
00:50:40,766 --> 00:50:43,933
that he's not informed about his own culture

1065
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,800
or that he's not as connected

1066
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,666
so let's ask him about the bomber jacket now what

1067
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:54,700
what this

1068
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:56,900
it's just seasonal clothing

1069
00:50:58,333 --> 00:50:59,800
he zips up the collar

1070
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:01,766
which is interesting

1071
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:05,400
in his body language I would see that also like

1072
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:07,766
he doesn't like that I'm observing this

1073
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:09,900
he doesn't like the idea that I have

1074
00:51:10,566 --> 00:51:13,533
seen something about him that most people don't

1075
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:16,966
where is this going

1076
00:51:18,266 --> 00:51:19,933
again avoidance right

1077
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,800
not acknowledging my question

1078
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,766
but trying as hard as he can to keep this as like

1079
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,733
unemotional and uninsightful as possible

1080
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,366
see Kim I have this place in my head 

1081
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:36,966
point to your head

1082
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:38,966
where I develop new ideas and connections

1083
00:51:38,966 --> 00:51:41,766
interesting I think it's called a brain

1084
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,700
okay and something happened in that brain

1085
00:51:47,466 --> 00:51:49,591
yes my brain suspects you have some kind of thing

1086
00:51:49,591 --> 00:51:51,566
 with the Revolutionary Air Brigades 

1087
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:55,666
I do not have a thing with Revolutionary Air Brigades in particular 

1088
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,000
just air brigades okay

1089
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:59,500
I wanted to become an aerostatic pilot

1090
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,566
then I turned 10

1091
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:03,166
and realized we no longer have an air force

1092
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,600
okay

1093
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,933
again I would ask him here at this point

1094
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:10,400
as he's a little bit closer

1095
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,266
he's feeling a little bit anxious

1096
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,766
or he has the potential to get to the point where he's like 

1097
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,933
I wanted to become a pilot

1098
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,066
and I realized that we no longer have one

1099
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:27,166
I never got an opportunity to be the thing I want

1100
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,549
or to be a revolutionary 

1101
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:33,733
or to contribute to my culture in the way that I would connect with 

1102
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,917
are you sure the revolutionary has gotten nothing to do with this 

1103
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:46,357
is this conversation that provocative

1104
00:52:46,357 --> 00:52:47,466
 well it's not like

1105
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:49,866
it's not supposed to sound like an argument

1106
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,266
but just look at his responses

1107
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,931
look at how avoidedant they are 

1108
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:54,966
look at how

1109
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,362
short his responses are 

1110
00:52:58,362 --> 00:53:01,533
and questioning of why I'm asking this 

1111
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,333
and he's trying to keep it mundane right

1112
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,133
like he's shooting down my question

1113
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,766
these are all signs of avoidance

1114
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,166
avoidance of like digging deeper into something

1115
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,200
good

1116
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:20,666
he glances impatiently at his electrostatic wristwatch

1117
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:22,800
see look anxiety is going up

1118
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:25,533
tell me a secret about yourself

1119
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:29,000
he does not like to get personal

1120
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,800
no

1121
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:34,100
I'm gonna ask again

1122
00:53:36,866 --> 00:53:39,733
your brain sends the signal to your lips

1123
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,800
but they refuse the order

1124
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,466
something is paralyzing them

1125
00:53:45,066 --> 00:53:47,866
you're pretty sure it has something to do with

1126
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,700
the lieutenants eyebrow

1127
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,500
the eyebrow is exercising psionic control over you

1128
00:53:56,533 --> 00:54:00,266
okay so we're getting a little anxious in our own line of questioning 

1129
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:01,510
what's happening to me

1130
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:02,400
something the matter detective

1131
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,733
this doesn't work if I'm also starting to feel anxious

1132
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:10,600
this guy's got authority off the charts

1133
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,733
with just the flick of his eyebrow is

1134
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:14,400
able to make you is through

1135
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:17,933
look at the way my character sees people 

1136
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,966
always organizing relationships in terms of authority

1137
00:54:23,366 --> 00:54:27,166
nothing you better hope he doesn't abuse his authority

1138
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,366
there's a lot of it

1139
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:36,966
he's one he we're not

1140
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:40,333
we're not like psychologically equipped enough to get him here 

1141
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,266
that is why we were an ex therapist in this playthrough

1142
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,500
there is just no way for us to

1143
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,566
to get him there

1144
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,533
but we did learn something

1145
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:56,766
we did learn something about him and

1146
00:54:56,966 --> 00:54:59,533
we know the signs of avoidance for him

1147
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:02,300
I'm just gonna silently scream

1148
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,700
if the lieutenant were an

1149
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,900
evil man who knows what sort of havocache break

1150
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,000
fortunately he is a committed officer of the RCM

1151
00:55:12,466 --> 00:55:16,266
he'll only use his powers for the good of the investigation 

1152
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,866
but never to connect to another human

1153
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,300
the lieutenant relaxes his eyeground

1154
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:24,566
and you seem to regain control of yourself

1155
00:55:24,766 --> 00:55:25,933
that was tense

1156
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:29,733
okay

1157
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:30,933
you win this time Kim

1158
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,100
that's correct

1159
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:35,200
that makes him a binoclard

1160
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:39,700
completely un-cop material if you say so yourself

1161
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:43,133
yeah good thing for empathy

1162
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:48,000
from my perspective though I think Kim

1163
00:55:49,466 --> 00:55:55,966
realized that we are so much more capable of digging into people 

1164
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,966
from a psyche perspective than the details like and

1165
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,900
that's evident by like this is our character right

1166
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,600
like these are the things we understand

1167
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:12,328
we understand like innate motivation and mental health  

1168
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:17,844
we understand mind's ability to make metaphorical connections  

1169
00:56:17,844 --> 00:56:21,566
we understand how to recognize and identify with emotions 

1170
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,500
we organize the world in terms of authority

1171
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,766
we are able to intuit

1172
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:29,533
different things through these two pathways

1173
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:35,666
he knows we're fucking totally useless in this area  

1174
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,900
and that's where we sort of grind up against him but

1175
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:45,966
we just showed him something that we're very powerful in 

1176
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:48,733
which is like getting him to feel uncomfortable

1177
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:50,700
and that that's gonna be a valuable skill

1178
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,000
for the rest of our investigation 

1179
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,666
yeah we're extremely stupid

1180
00:56:57,066 --> 00:56:58,100
like intellectual

1181
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:05,333
okay we've already tried provoking him and it didn't work

1182
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:07,266
I'm not gonna try it again this way

1183
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:07,947
I'll wait 

1184
00:57:07,947 --> 00:57:10,900
are they they're mostly just cumberson 

1185
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:15,533
you could use a good normal pair yourself

1186
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:17,333
yeah I could fucking use some glasses

1187
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:17,866
I couldn't even

1188
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:20,500
spot the siggy in Tommy's hands right in front of me

1189
00:57:21,766 --> 00:57:23,466
do you ever talk with yourself

1190
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,933
when you're thinking do you ever have conversations

1191
00:57:26,933 --> 00:57:29,266
I have no idea what you're talking about

1192
00:57:30,766 --> 00:57:31,566
so

1193
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,500
does he have one of these systems

1194
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,000
I guess is what we're wondering

1195
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,500
chimes in with advice or warnings

1196
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,466
when I need to think I just use my notebook

1197
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,500
the lieutenant produces his small blue note

1198
00:57:50,826 --> 00:57:53,100
and idly thumbs through

1199
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,400
a blue is from mystery

1200
00:57:54,566 --> 00:57:58,333
that's where his conversations with himself take place

1201
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,966
you're super lucid yet psychedelic 

1202
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,500
you don't need office supplies to connect to your nervous system 

1203
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:06,600
you're special

1204
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:09,666
I am special thank you electrochemistry 

1205
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:12,400
electrochemistry makes me feel good about myself

1206
00:58:12,466 --> 00:58:15,000
good let's change this subject

1207
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:22,166
no response he just arches his brow

1208
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:26,266
have you tried concentrating on something other than your personal affairs 

1209
00:58:26,866 --> 00:58:29,800
there is a sudden harsh edge to his voice

1210
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:33,733
like he's tired of hearing about your personal affairs

1211
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,933
that's because Kim is the kind of person

1212
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:37,600
who doesn't think that

1213
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:40,300
being a good detective means knowing things

1214
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,466
about yourself

1215
00:58:42,366 --> 00:58:46,466
because I find him to have an extreme lack of self insight 

1216
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:49,866
as evidenced by the exchange we just had

1217
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,566
like I think that he

1218
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,900
puts all of his thoughts in his notebook

1219
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,466
and he doesn't engage with his own competing mental states 

1220
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:01,866
because he's afraid of what the fuck they would tell him to do 

1221
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:05,166
and that there's a part of him that is just as unhinged

1222
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,100
if not more than we are

1223
00:59:11,772 --> 00:59:12,500
not a fan

1224
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,683
what's wrong with personal fair

1225
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,466
it's just the nature of lieutenancy

1226
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,933
is that a mask you're wearing Kim

1227
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:22,800
the RCM deploys a self style structure

1228
00:59:22,866 --> 00:59:26,733
called the Decomptage as its chain of command

1229
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,666
every lieutenant is responsible for 2 sergeants and 8 officers 

1230
00:59:31,933 --> 00:59:35,300
that means the average lieutenant has to deal with

1231
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,700
quite a few personal affairs

1232
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:39,766
even you know this

1233
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:41,966
yeah

1234
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,566
easy easy

1235
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:44,700
encyclopedia

1236
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:50,300
so why are you hiding Kim

1237
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:51,600
why are you hiding

1238
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,733
the fact that you have a personal life

1239
00:59:57,733 --> 00:59:58,700
can you help me

1240
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,500
fine

1241
00:59:59,635 --> 01:00:01,402
we should get through this day first

1242
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:03,566
off hours begin at 9 PM

1243
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,500
if you are still having trouble then

1244
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,300
I can give you an orientation

1245
01:00:07,966 --> 01:00:09,266
so what should I get

1246
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
the case at hand

1247
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,466
it can work miracles

1248
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:15,836
oh so you pour everything into work 

1249
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:18,366
to avoid dealing with your personal affairs

1250
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:19,200
interesting

1251
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,666
really you look fine to me

1252
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,300
I

1253
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:24,700
have a lot of damage

1254
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,266
the phycho-drama is unbecoming of an officer

1255
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:32,300
wait what you

1256
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,366
you're gonna call out

1257
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:36,400
you're gonna call out my psyche my psycho drama

1258
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,766
that's my whole thing

1259
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:39,166
Kim it's all I got

1260
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,666
sort of major brain damage has occurred

1261
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:46,266
then you should consider seeking medical attention

1262
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,966
you can use the radio in my Kineema to call your station's lazareth

1263
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,266
was there anything else you wanted

1264
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,400
you seem to be following me

1265
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,400
fine just an observation

1266
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,533
I don't want to tell him to fuck off

1267
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:01,333
you have

1268
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,066
a distinctive way of walking

1269
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,266
if I were to walk in front of you

1270
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,666
we would surely collide

1271
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,927
what do you mean distinctive 

1272
01:01:08,927 --> 01:01:10,333
I hope you don't take this the wrong way

1273
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,700
it's just a collegial observation

1274
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:15,933
in the 57th we call it the Jamrock Shuffle

1275
01:01:16,466 --> 01:01:20,666
officers from Jamrock's 41st Precinct tend to move a bit erratically 

1276
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:24,966
they say it's a scene clearing technique developed by one of your 

1277
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:27,066
lieutenants for gathering evidence

1278
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:29,300
it's erratic yet thorough

1279
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:31,500
prioritizes containers

1280
01:01:33,533 --> 01:01:34,700
why containers

1281
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:37,473
containers contain I guess

1282
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:39,333
 I'm making assumptions

1283
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:40,533
we should move on

1284
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:44,579
passing along frivolous interdepartmental stereotypes  

1285
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:47,066
is not usually his oeuvre

1286
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:48,900
he regrets bringing it up

1287
01:01:52,866 --> 01:01:56,500
why did you why did you say that Kim it was weird

1288
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:00,533
OK

1289
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,200
so

1290
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:05,966
I feel like

1291
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,866
we have done a lot and also accomplished nothing

1292
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,666
from the time I left the dock

1293
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:20,100
I don't know if I really

1294
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,266
actually accomplished much of anything

1295
01:02:22,266 --> 01:02:24,333
I mean we did the autopsy and

1296
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,100
I'm trying to get like

1297
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,666
on team Cuno

1298
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,933
we didn't investigate the union

1299
01:02:32,933 --> 01:02:34,866
I didn't even go talk to that person

1300
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,266
we didn't find my badge

1301
01:02:37,266 --> 01:02:40,166
I still don't have any fucking cigarettes

1302
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:43,533
I did get my tie back

1303
01:02:43,533 --> 01:02:44,933
I've done a lot of like

1304
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,066
to me very important things

1305
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,066
okay I'm piecing together my identity and I'm

1306
01:02:52,266 --> 01:02:55,200
I'm trying to figure out like

1307
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,066
how should I be to survive in this world around me like

1308
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:07,100
who do I need to like listen to who's trustworthy 

1309
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:11,466
what benefits do I have of interacting with Cuno

1310
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:14,333
with Garte the bartender like

1311
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,800
because at the very beginning of the game

1312
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,666
I was just going around

1313
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,733
talking to anybody and not really being very

1314
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:22,800
like deliberate about it

1315
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:26,266
and that wasn't very successful for me to be honest

1316
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,133
yeah we didn't we didn't accomplish

1317
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:34,333
much in terms of like the game systems but

1318
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,358
this has been an important like task for me 

1319
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:46,566
 to explore like the environments and myself in this environment 

1320
01:03:46,566 --> 01:03:48,666
I feel like I did learn a lot about where my character

1321
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:50,733
is coming from

1322
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:54,845
and why he would be interested in learning about himself 

1323
01:03:54,845 --> 01:03:56,933
I think the conversation with Lena

1324
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:01,900
was really important for like 

1325
01:04:03,066 --> 01:04:05,600
establishing a sense of like self empathy

1326
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:09,300
sessing out the world

1327
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:09,666
yeah

1328
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,533
and now we know a little bit more about the person

1329
01:04:11,533 --> 01:04:14,366
that were campaigning with 

1330
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,533
maybe the real elysium was the friends we made along the way 

1331
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,866
could be very true

1332
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,300
well

1333
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,600
I think that this is where

1334
01:04:25,133 --> 01:04:28,266
it would be good to pause the play through again for now 

1335
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,277
I feel like this was a good stopping point 

1336
01:04:32,277 --> 01:04:34,866
to sort of like reflect on what we learned 

1337
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,966
I realized that this is going to take a very long time

1338
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:42,100
to like complete this game but 

1339
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,700
hey if it leads to interesting psychological discourse then 

1340
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,400
that is primarily what I'm going for here

1341
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,366
