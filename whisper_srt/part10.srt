Hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elisium analysis series.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,040
On today's episode we're going to address something kind of unavoidable in a game like this,

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,940
which is what are some of the crossovers between politics and mental health and kind of

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,020
some personal struggles I have about integrating those two subjects.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,330
I'm sure there will be a lot of discussion about this in the comments, just know that this

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:32,810
is all recorded previously. I think I'm going to probably make a dedicated video at some

7
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:38,560
point kind of like compiling my thoughts a little more, but yeah, to get an early look

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,540
at kind of where my, my, my, my stomach's going to be problemless.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,260
Aside from that, we have a very special moment in this episode, which is finally we're

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,600
going to reach the end of our first day as a detective. It's taken us a while and we're

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,080
going to take another look at how Kim and I's relationship has been developing over this

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,640
very challenging day and see if there's actually some things that we've become like close

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,120
on. So, all that's coming up, I'm excited to get into it.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,420
Let's do it.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,120
Alrighty, we are going to talk to Kim.

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,850
We should think about calling it today maybe. The nights are still miserably cold this

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,200
time of year. I haven't paid the cafeteria manager for the damages yet.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,380
Should take care of that then.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,780
I don't have the money.

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,540
I'm stuck to him anyway. An office of the RCM shouldn't be sleeping in the street. We'll

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,500
figure something out.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,000
Though he finds this situation frustrating, he is doing his best to not make you feel

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,980
any worse than you already do.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,560
I respect that, Kim. He's, he's, Kim is one of a lot of points with me this, in these

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,100
chapters of our stream.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,520
Okay, let's see if we can reason with this gentleman.

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,020
Can I help you?

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,100
But I don't have another option here.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,940
Yes, have you got it?

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,100
Can we come to some sort of arrangement?

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,460
Does that arrangement include you paying me what we already agreed you owe me?

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,580
Kim is about to say something. Let him. Let's do that.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,920
I understand your predicament as the manager. However, I feel I must remind you that we are

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,880
here to conduct an important investigation that also affects your business.

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,820
That's a good point. Put the squeeze on him.

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,100
Give me for saying this, but your colleagues seems more committed to drinking and...

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,100
He stops me in sentence.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,100
He shrinks back a bit under the Lieutenant-Severge's.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,020
I mean no effects. It's really nothing personal. I just have to protect the interests of this

40
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,620
establishment.

41
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,270
No, kiddie.

42
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,480
Kiddie.
