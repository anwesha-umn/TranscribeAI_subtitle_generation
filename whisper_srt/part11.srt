Hello and welcome to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series. So on

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,540
today's episode I'm very excited because we are finally getting to use one of my

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,800
absolute favorite frameworks for analyzing characters. This is something that I

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,380
use in therapy from time to time and it's an incredible way to explore patterns

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,560
of psychology and patterns of behavior and sort of really uncover what is

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,660
driving a lot of the complexes that we see play out in Harry's thoughts and his

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,380
actions. And the reason we were doing that now is because we are starting to

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,130
learn more about ourselves and our past. We're going to take another look at

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,580
that ledger and see what do we actually think about the person that we used to

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,020
be before we became a sorry cop. All that's coming up so let's jump back in.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:04,440
Oh there it is. There it is. We are back. We are so back. I'm so excited. Okay so we

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:13,040
are back in the game now. I just wanted to say the community that has arrived

13
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,410
around like this game and specifically this playthrough continues to

14
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,220
amaze me especially after last episode was like a lot of politics talk and I was

15
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,180
very like anxious avoidant of talking about politics. I have been very encouraged

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:36,700
by the response to that last episode to like not be so anxious about it. I

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,700
don't I still don't know if I'm gonna like start getting full political but I

18
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,440
will try not to like avoid it in the game because of my personal issues with

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,280
with getting political. I'll just say that I I won't let it divert the game

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,540
because at the end of the day I want to talk about like mental health and

21
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,520
there's probably some interesting avenues in the narrative of the game that

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,540
will miss out on if I just totally ignore it. However I will say this game is

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,660
so wonderfully designed that it you have a main character who has a real back

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,150
story. He's not like a blank slate like I thought that he was gonna be from

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,820
the beginning. He has his own back story and at the same time it allows you to

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,010
have your own beliefs and and to and the character will like have the same

27
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,940
behavioral patterns. Like genuinely imagine if like literally Brady was the

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,840
detective. Imagine it what you know about me so far. How I would go about

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,920
solving a murder would be exactly like you've seen it like I would spend

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:59,200
crazy amounts of time on things that you just wouldn't like you.
