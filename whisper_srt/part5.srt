Hello, and welcome back to our therapist plays disco elicium. Let's play if you're new here

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,580
Hello, my name is Brady. I'm a therapist and we're doing kind of like a long-form psycho analysis of our

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,680
main character and all the people that we meet in our

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,870
twisted weird journey through

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,780
Revishol in disco elicium. So on today's episode we're kind of getting

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,910
deeper into the analysis and

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:33,900
actually kind of targeting our companion Kim who at least in my playthrough and the way I'm sort of roleplaying this character

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,580
We don't have like the most

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,240
trusting relationship with yet and kind of getting into the psychology of like what does it mean to

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,440
want to trust someone

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,500
But not be sure if you can yet and how does someone who has a lot of like prior trauma like our main character does

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,340
actually evaluate whether or not someone who

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,300
Promises to be there on your side is actually trustworthy in what they say so today

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,440
I'm gonna give you kind of a mix of psychological theory behind this idea and also how I would actually address something like this in

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,260
Practice as a therapist so that said let's continue

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,680
Okay, so

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,240
What do I need to do?

18
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,180
I need to ask I need to solve this murder

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,620
Like I gotta be honest like the the murder is like the lowest priority thing to my character right now

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,840
I genuinely believe that if I'm this character

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,980
The murder is just a vehicle to discover more about who I was and in that process

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,980
Reckoning with the idea that I may have done something to myself to try to forget that person and here

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure that out

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,500
I could go do oh

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,080
I can go do the autopsy I have the gloves and I have the form

26
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,560
Maybe I should do that

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,020
I'm just collecting tasks

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,180
Jam mystery I kind of want to go see the body let's do the notch-ops zero quick I have all the ingredients I need

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,180
See what happens

30
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,440
If you don't tell us something provide us information

31
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,920
The rotting man lies on his side with his eyes looking straight through you

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:03:00,000
The belt is still around his neck his body is supine and open to intrusion by autopsy. Let's do that turn it
