1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,420
Okay, let's talk about why we make bad decisions.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:12,070
So if you're like me, then you've probably been in that situation where it's the end

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,200
of the day or it's the morning and you're thinking like, okay, I'm going to make a solid

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,700
plan for myself.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
Today I'm going to be disciplined.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,820
I'm going to come home from work and I'm going to get all these errands done and I'm going

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,210
to treat myself really well. I'm going to make a nice, healthy, proper meal. I'm going

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,720
to go to the gym afterwards. I'm going to exercise. And then maybe when I come home, I'll

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,920
like start reading a book or something. I'll do something a little different, something

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,020
that makes me feel like I'm going to advance my life in a new, positive direction.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,860
This is our real life volition and it's there to lead you on your way to making good life

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,440
decisions.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,490
But this doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes you get to the end of the day and you

14
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:05,160
realize that you haven't been very disciplined at all. A lot of those errands are still

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,630
incomplete or like half-started. We didn't end up going to the gym and instead of making

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,580
a proper meal, we've ordered some definitely not healthy takeout food.

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,080
And instead of reading that book, maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,100
and we've not advanced our life in a positive meaningful direction in any way at all.

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,900
What is happening here? Why would we ignore the voice of volition that's telling us to

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,980
do all of these beneficial positive things?

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,180
Well, it could be a lot of things, honestly. And definitely having like a mental health

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,540
diagnosis is going to amplify this problem a lot more. But even for the average person,

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,160
this happens pretty often. It certainly happens to me.

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,860
So what I wanted to share with you today is a framework for understanding why this problem

25
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,440
happens and what we can actually do about it. This is a real problem that actually comes

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,240
up in my work as a therapist kind of often. And I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated

27
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,780
so clearly. And given such a unique role within the structure of a game, like Disco

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,340
Felicium has, so okay, there is a reason that we do not always follow the voice of volition

29
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,420
and go through with our good intentions. And it has to do with something called psychological

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,840
friction. So in this context, friction is any force either internal or external, which

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,720
opposes a behavioral change. So what do we know about like regular friction, right?

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,800
If I am standing on an ice rink and I move my body weight around a little bit, I'm going

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,280
to start sliding around on the ice. There's not a lot of friction between me and the surface

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,860
that's under me. When I step off the ice and now I'm standing on concrete, when I shift

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,020
myself around, I'm...
