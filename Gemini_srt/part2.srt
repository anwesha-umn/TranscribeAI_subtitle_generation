1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,339
okay hello and welcome back

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,700
to our playthrough of disco elysium

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,779
we just finished the first chunk

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,900
of the game starting our character

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,119
yeah just figuring out who he is

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,239
in this wild disgusting world

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:22,320
and how wild and disgusting are we

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
going to be to meet the world

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,859
so I've decided that the character profile

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,980
we're going with is like x

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,859
or failed therapist turned dirty cop

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,000
I tried to be a therapist

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,820
but I found it too easy to manipulate people

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,780
the more I learned about people

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,939
the more I couldn't help exploiting that

16
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,039
so I became a cop instead

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,020
where I can hide behind a moral justification

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,020
for getting information from people

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,079
I can code that as a good thing

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
for me and them; I'm protecting them

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,880
by figuring out their dark secrets

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,079
so that's kind of where we're at

23
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,060
let's continue and keep working

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,599
on this crime

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,200
literally just came back at the perfect time

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,819
hell yeah let's look and go

27
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,340
okay let's check out the crime scene

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,420
get some cash lying around

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:22,500
never gonna let that go to waste

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,040
some more magnesium

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,859
we're gonna need to stock up

32
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,019
this mechanism has been oxidating for years

33
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,700
the kids ' ladder is climbable

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,480
not too much interesting going on

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,700
let's check out the body

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,120
with bulging white eyes

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,540
the face does not look human

38
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,379
it's swollen and ready to burst

39
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,560
his lips are fish - like

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,079
and his tongue like a ball gag

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,219
okay it's pretty gruesome

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,599
you seem to be holding your breath

43
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,420
the cargo belt twists his neck

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,719
at an unnatural angle

45
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,180
the body below appears stiff

46
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,900
it's letting out an ungodly rot

47
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,800
the smell seeps in

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,560
even through your clenched nostrils

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,979
legendary let go of your nose

50
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:18,900
without throwing up

51
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,539
that's 17 %

52
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,340
has not steered me wrong yet

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,800
oh it looks like my camera is frozen
