1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,700
hello and welcome to my therapist

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,099
plays disco elicium analysis series

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,780
on today's episode we are meeting

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,359
what has become another favorite character

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,119
that we've met so far

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,460
so we're gonna be talking

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,880
a lot with a net and her mother

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,000
today learning more about the economic reality

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,539
of being a child who has to work

10
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,460
out in the cold all day

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,539
and in that dialogue we're also gonna be

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,320
continuing to build our own character profile

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,940
sort of continuing the analysis

14
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,120
using the jahari window

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,299
that we started in the last episode

16
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,560
there's a lot of emotions to dig into

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,100
and discuss in today's episode

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,719
including some that may come up

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,719
when we finally face ourselves

20
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,079
so that's where we're at

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,820
I'm excited to continue

22
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,200
so let's jump back in

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:54,439
okay what shall we do next

24
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,060
I guess we can go enter the green

25
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,619
the door behind the green house

26
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,600
let's go do that

27
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,379
it's in the yard basement door

28
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:08,079
is that back there

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,219
yeah it's more useful on counseling

30
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:31,980
what is this girl up to

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,260
it's been a while since we've checked in

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,599
she is way too positive

33
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,180
oh it's snowing

34
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,700
what is this crime

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,400
it's about murders or burglaries

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,200
or things like that and the work

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,099
of a policeman or a private detective

38
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,859
who's trying to solve a crime

39
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:56,540
and catch the criminals

40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,459
I need to know what crime is

41
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:07,519
it's that bad pointy red

42
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,120
crime is what we were solving

43
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,099
before this conversation began

44
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,740
why would anyone want to read a crime

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,099
they get to imagine dangerous things

46
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,539
and it's kind of like a puzzle

47
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,099
where you can guess who the criminal is

48
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,419
or how the good guys are going to catch him

49
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,819
I'm a policeman myself by the way

50
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,439
I don't look much like a policeman

51
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:29,960
I know

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,379
well what does a cop look like that

53
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,919
she points to a book cover

54
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,800
on which you can see strapping

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,020
vesparteen officer

56
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,300
he stems grinly over the body

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,139
of a dead woman

58
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,060
you know nobody actually looks

59
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,400
like the guy in the picture

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,860
it's not your body that's important

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,509
in police work

62
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,300
it's your head
