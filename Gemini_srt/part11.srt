00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,200
hello and welcome to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,820
so on today's episode I'm very excited

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,220
we are finally getting to use one of my favorite frameworks

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,380
this is something I use in therapy

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,219
it's an incredible way to explore patterns of psychology

6
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,379
it's also a way to explore patterns of behavior

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,640
we uncover what drives the complexes we see

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,019
these complexes play out in harry's thoughts and actions

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,660
the reason we're doing that now is this: 

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,159
we are starting to learn more about ourselves

11
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,399
we're learning more about our past

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,820
we'll take another look at that ledger

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,780
what do we think about the person we used to be

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,079
all that's coming up so let's jump back in

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,000
oh there it is

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,460
we are back

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,880
I'm so excited

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,039
we are back in the game now

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,619
I wanted to say this: 

20
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,420
the community around this game amazes me

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,500
this playthrough continues to amaze me

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:04,140
last episode was a lot of politics talk

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,500
I was anxious about talking about politics

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,540
I have been encouraged by the response

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,500
I don't know if I'll get fully political

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,739
I will try not to avoid it in the game

27
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,500
I won't let it divert the game

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,239
I want to talk about mental health

29
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:29,560
there are interesting avenues in the narrative

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,439
I will say this: 

31
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,560
this game is wonderfully designed

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,299
the main character has a real backstory

33
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,939
he's not a blank slate

34
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:38,939
he has his own backstory

35
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,700
it allows you to have your own beliefs

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,620
the character will have the same behavioral patterns

37
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,459
imagine brady as the detective

38
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:51,799
imagine what you know about me

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,840
how I'd solve a murder would be exactly like this

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,260
I'd spend crazy amounts of time on things

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,079
you just wouldn't like you
