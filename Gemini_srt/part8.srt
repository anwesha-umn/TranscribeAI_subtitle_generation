00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,180
hello and welcome back to my therapist plays

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,860
disco elisium analysis series

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,599
okay I'm really excited about today's episode

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,800
we're finally getting into our first encounter

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,679
with the union boss everart claire

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,559
and kind of breaking down lots of different

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,920
psychological angles on power dynamics

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,399
we have a lot to share today

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,899
on real techniques that I actually use

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,379
in my practice as a therapist

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,800
to navigate difficult conversations

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,700
with people who don't want to talk to you

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,299
or are in some sort of power struggle

14
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,619
how do you get that person opening up

15
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:37,979
about things

16
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,780
we're going to use some of those techniques

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,020
on mr claire

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,920
by the end of this episode we're going to learn

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,460
a little bit more about ourselves

20
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,640
and what kind of comp we are

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,500
yes we're finally getting our copo type

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,219
I'm sure very few of you will be surprised

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,740
so I'm excited to share this one

24
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,619
let's dive in

25
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,340
okay so I have an objective

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,140
I have the objective to progress this game's storyline

27
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,000
like I do want to mention why I am going

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,060
about playing this game this way

29
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,840
because I do think it's relevant

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,939
when you see my character do things

31
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,599
like just totally give up on pursuing

32
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,599
the narrative to try to find cigarettes

33
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,239
for example

34
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,060
this is a roleplay

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,079
so sometimes I'm going to be speaking

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,239
as like brady the therapist

37
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,980
sometimes I'm going to be speaking

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,959
as like brady the degenerate

39
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,120
who is using this as a kind of escapism

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,200
from my very serious real life

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,159
this is where I get to give me a goofball

42
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,280
and sometimes I'm going to like speak

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,340
from the voice of my character

44
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,140
and just like say random nonsense garbage

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,299
that I think he would say or think

46
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,560
and one of the things that is really important

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,079
about this character specifically

48
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,620
because he is someone representing the struggle

49
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,159
of addiction is how like we have all kinds

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,860
of priority structures in our mind

51
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,620
like there's the whole just basic needs

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,039
hierarchy of like you need food

53
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,120
you need water

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,219
you need rest

55
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:25,419
and only once those things are satisfied

56
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:28,719
can you really focus on like higher order things

57
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,039
like you know your self - esteem

58
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,680
and your self - worth and the balance of health

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,560
and your relationships and those sorts of things

60
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,319
the problem with addiction is that your body

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,300
has become dependent on a chemical

62
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,599
one that's harmful to you

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,139
so it completely hijacks what should be

64
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,280
a normal set of priorities
