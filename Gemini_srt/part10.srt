00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,620
hello and welcome back to my therapist

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,660
plays disco elisium analysis series

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,900
on today's episode we're going to address something

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,800
it's unavoidable in a game like this

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,460
which is what are some crossovers

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,119
between politics and mental health

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,940
and some personal struggles I have

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,140
integrating those two subjects

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,019
I'm sure there will be discussion

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,420
in the comments this is all recorded previously

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,019
I think I'm going to make a dedicated video

12
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:30,019
compiling my thoughts a little more

13
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,659
to get an early look at where my stomach's going

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,299
aside from that we have a special moment

15
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:38,560
we're going to reach the end of our first day

16
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,780
as a detective it's taken us a while

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,960
we're going to take another look

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,899
at how kim and i's relationship has been developing

19
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,759
over this very challenging day

20
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,280
see if there's some things we've become close on

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,039
so all that's coming up

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm excited to get into it

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:52,659
let's do it

24
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,600
alrighty we are going to talk to kim

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,619
we should think about calling it today maybe

26
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:00,799
the nights are still miserably cold

27
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,560
this time of year

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,480
I haven't paid the cafeteria manager for the damages yet

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,260
should take care of that then

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,680
I don't have the money

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,920
I'm stuck to him anyway

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,859
an office of the rcm shouldn't be sleeping in the street

33
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,040
we'll figure something out

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,560
though he finds this situation frustrating

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,120
he is doing his best to not make you feel worse

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,459
than you already do

37
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:26,060
I respect that kim

38
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,140
he's kim is one of a lot of points with me

39
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,120
in these chapters of our stream

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,459
okay let's see if we can reason with this gentleman

41
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,260
can I help you

42
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,120
but I don't have another option here

43
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,599
yes have you got it

44
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,459
can we come to some sort of arrangement

45
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,439
does that arrangement include you paying me

46
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,560
what we already agreed you owe me

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,900
kim is about to say something

48
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,519
let him

49
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,659
let's do that

50
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,799
I understand your predicament as the manager

51
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,980
however I feel I must remind you

52
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,520
that we are here to conduct an important investigation

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,460
that also affects your business

54
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,360
that's a good point

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,139
put the squeeze on him

56
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,360
give me for saying this but your colleagues

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,259
seem more committed to drinking and

58
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,780
he stops me in sentence

59
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,659
he shrinks back a bit

60
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:28,539
under the lieutenant - severge's

61
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,199
I mean no effects

62
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,879
it's really nothing personal

63
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,340
I just have to protect the interests

64
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,680
of this establishment

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,240
no kiddie kiddie
