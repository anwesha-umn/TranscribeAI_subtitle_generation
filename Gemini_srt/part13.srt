00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,980
hello and welcome to my therapist

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,000
plays disco lesium analysis series

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,280
so on today's episode the plot

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,519
we will see if we can establish authority

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,939
with tidus the union boss

6
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:16,059
we're gonna see if we can get closer

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,710
to a confession from him

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,820
on who was involved with the murder

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,620
in marche nays

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,379
and on the analysis side

11
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,219
we're taking a deep dive

12
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,460
into the rigorous self - critique thought

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,100
now that we finally internalize this

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,699
it opens the door for discussion

15
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,079
on harry's sense of self

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,259
is he actually a good person

17
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,000
does he think it's possible to become one

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,780
this is heavier on the analysis

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,299
but it's exciting to peel back layers

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,179
of our character

21
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,240
let's jump in

22
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,039
any predictions on where the story will go

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,479
or who's the killer

24
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:50,520
I had the idea that we would be involved

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,920
in the killing because we are uninitiated

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,159
to our own past

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
I don't think we did it

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,600
I have the suspicion that the dock workers

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,340
are a red herring

30
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,540
I just don't buy it

31
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,659
that's what we're leading

32
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,780
but I could be wrong

33
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,939
I am notoriously bad at predicting the plot

34
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,319
of anything as you've probably noticed

35
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,659
but when politics or the plot

36
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,019
are part of the dialogue

37
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:23,500
my brain condenses down

38
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,700
I've had to do this before

39
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,099
okay what is happening here

40
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,200
my brain is equipped for character analysis

41
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,040
when I'm watching something

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm not thinking about the plot

43
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,620
I'm not like watching shutter island

44
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,939
and wondering what's gonna happen next

45
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,079
my brain accepts whatever happens

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,959
but I'm thinking about what the character feels

47
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,799
how whatever happens will change their worldview

48
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,719
that's where my mind is focused

49
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,200
I just accept the plot

50
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,439
it doesn't matter that much to me

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,480
the sequence of things happening

52
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,939
unless it's so egregious

53
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,019
what if it was lena

54
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,760
I refuse to accept that lena

55
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,980
is too kindhearted and good - natured

56
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,640
for her to be involved in that

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,760
it's funny therapists often struggle

58
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,500
with predicting stuff or telling if someone is lying

59
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,400
well that's true because
