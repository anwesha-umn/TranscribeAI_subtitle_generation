00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,899
hello and welcome to another episode

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:06,019
it's my therapist plays disco elysium analysis

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,279
this time I wanted to share something

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,080
I learned about a character in the game

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
I also learned about myself

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,839
this is during the uploading of this series

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,559
just for context if you're just joining

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,739
I'm playing through the game

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:20,600
it's from a therapist's perspective

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,500
I provide commentary on mental health

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,199
it's depicted in the game

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,579
there's a lot more going on

13
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,960
but I'm not the person to comment

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
I can't comment on complicated political stuff

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,380
one important dynamic is with your partner

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,259
that's kim kitsuragi

17
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,399
as the player we're more aware of kim's qualities

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
my character the detective is not

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I've been exploring the subject

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,140
it's someone coming from a background of trauma

21
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,200
we still don't know a lot about rafael

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,380
his issues with authority and relationships

23
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,539
his struggles with substance abuse indicate trauma

24
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,979
I've been approaching dialogue with kim

25
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:55,380
we have an initial impression of someone

26
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,240
we may want to trust them

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
if we have trust issues we may test it

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,840
we may see where the real boundaries are

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,340
my character's trying to see

30
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,120
does kim stick around because he needs me

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,079
or are his qualities earnest and trustworthy

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,120
are those things going to last

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,780
we make ourselves very difficult to be around

34
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,120
I'm going to ask him

35
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,120
I want to impress him

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,219
I want him to think I'm cool

37
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,519
I'm not a f * * * ing mess

38
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:27,879
I've been demonstrating

39
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,840
some close relationships are tested

40
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,599
they outlast the period of testing

41
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,340
if I push this person will they stick with me

42
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,680
the lieutenant bears his nose in his notebook

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,739
there's another thing I'm unsure about kim

44
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,959
she gave an honest reflection

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,659
she empathized with me

46
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,319
kim showed me disappointment and mistrust
