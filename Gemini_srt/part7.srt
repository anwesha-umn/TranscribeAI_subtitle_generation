00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,220
hello and welcome back to my therapist

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,379
plays disco elicium analysis series

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,660
so on today's episode we are delving deeper

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,480
into the psychology of our main character

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,939
this case gets more complicated

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,500
so does our relationship with ourselves

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,219
we're also going to start discovering more

8
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,219
about who we were and finding that

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,980
we are not so happy with that person

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,120
before we had our amnesia

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,859
and woke up as the person we are today

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,480
so what does it mean to be faced

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,440
with some of those challenges

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,679
do we avoid them and try to shut them out

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,299
or do we look for healthy ways

16
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:38,840
to integrate them and move forward

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,000
but we also do get into major confrontation

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
we're going to face what it is like

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,759
when we go up against an individual

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,340
named measurehead who stands between us

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,939
and our next objective in solving the case

22
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:56,420
so all that is coming up in today's episode

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,719
and perhaps our first moments of genuine trust

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,939
starting to build between ourselves and our partner kip

25
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,180
I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,959
so let's jump in

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,859
hey there's a big gentleman

28
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,120
scared

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:30,840
maybe this is the gentleman who was asking

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,260
about our case is a large lead

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,140
what's going on here

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:45,500
the broad shoulder alpha male turns to you

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,540
he's a full head taller than everybody else here

34
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,980
you hear to fuck with us

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,620
beat the honest worker down

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,019
why should I hear the fight for a cause

37
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:59,019
stripes usually have problems with people

38
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,920
who have causes

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,620
okay then I think I think no

40
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,520
I want to be on your team friend

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:08,610
good

42
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,759
we're fighting for a cause here

43
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,400
right to work

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,139
besides we're not that different

45
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:19,080
it helps if people see us talking

46
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,280
cops and strikebreakers together

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,479
shows our days are on our side

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,099
builds confidence

49
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:26,819
I like his perspective

50
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:27,379
I agree

51
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,539
I think it's also kind of a power play

52
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,060
that I'm like grinding the flashlight

53
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,900
and everybody's face because it makes them feel

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,439
like I'm really targeting them

55
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,659
which is good for my interrogation

56
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,340
what kind of trials are we talking about

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,699
well I don't want to politically align with him

58
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,759
but I want to be on his team
