00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,179
okay hello and also welcome

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,980
it's great to be back on stream

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,580
continuing our disco elicium playthrough

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,660
if you're just joining us which is a good chance that you are this is still at the beginning

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,199
it's the beginning of our little playthrough

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,300
what we're doing is playing through it

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,899
it's a mix of roleplay a mix of psychoanalysis

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,679
I'm brady I'm a therapist

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,440
I'm doing psychoanalysis on the characters

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,280
I'm linking that to the game design

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,440
it represents mental health

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,739
this game is in another league

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,979
I already did a video about the skill system

14
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,820
it represents motivation and psychological priority

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,679
we're going to get pretty deep with this

16
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,200
the last two streams I've been figuring out the game

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,740
I've had some time to collect thoughts

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,240
I'll be talking about the characters and their dynamics

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,439
my character shows avoidance and confrontation

20
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,960
he's not making the best decisions

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,820
I'm doing a mix of my own head canon in roleplay

22
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,579
I'm not trying to play the game the best way

23
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,659
I'm trying to make this a fun playthrough

24
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,180
we're not going to see every part of the game

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,980
we're not going to see every dialogue tree

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,239
that's okay

27
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,340
it's been great to get recommendations

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,280
my character has just fallen into failing upwards

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,159
he's passing some of the early skill checks

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,799
some comments said I skipped tutorials

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,700
that makes sense because I kind of feel lost

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,359
but that's okay

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,420
we're discovering it as we go

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,439
that makes for interesting playthrough dynamics

35
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,780
I'm fascinated by how well the game responded

36
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,480
it's completely fine that I skipped certain things

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,439
it's fine that I don't know how to play it well

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,299
I haven't reached a roadblock

39
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,439
the game is happy to let me move on

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,340
it lets me fail my way through everything

41
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,719
that's kind of life isn't it

42
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,859
so with that said
