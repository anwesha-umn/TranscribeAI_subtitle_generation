00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,839
hello and welcome back to our therapist plays disco elicium

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:05,980
let's play if you're new here

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,019
hello my name is brady

4
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:07,639
I'm a therapist

5
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,080
we're doing a long - form psychoanalysis

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,519
of our main character and all the people

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,679
that we meet in our twisted weird journey

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,760
through revishol in disco elicium

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,120
so on today's episode we're getting deeper

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,300
into the analysis and targeting our companion kim

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,199
who in my playthrough we don't have a trusting relationship with yet

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,420
and kind of getting into the psychology of trust

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,079
what does it mean to want to trust someone

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,179
but not be sure if you can yet

15
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:42,979
how does someone with prior trauma evaluate trust

16
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,039
whether someone who promises to be there is trustworthy

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,899
so today I'm giving you psychological theory

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,299
and how I'd address this in practice as a therapist

19
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,960
so that said let's continue

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,380
okay so what do I need to do

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,479
I need to ask

22
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,219
I need to solve this murder

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,579
the murder is the lowest priority

24
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,680
I genuinely believe that as this character the murder is a vehicle

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,819
to discover more about who I was

26
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,599
in that process reckoning with the idea

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,680
that I may have done something to myself

28
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,239
to try to forget that person

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,700
I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure that out

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,219
I could go do the autopsy

31
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,739
I have the gloves and the form

32
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,379
maybe I should do that

33
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:36,540
I'm just collecting tasks

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,019
I kind of want to go see the body

35
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,939
let's do the notch - ops zero quick

36
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,980
I have all the ingredients

37
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,519
see what happens

38
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,840
if you don't tell us something provide us information

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,879
the rotting man lies on his side

40
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,680
his eyes look straight through you

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,439
the belt is still around his neck

42
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,000
his body is supine and open to intrusion

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,760
let's do that

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,980
turn it
