1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,179
okay hello and welcome to the beginning

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,519
of a special playthrough of a game

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,740
that I have been talking about

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,859
with my community to play

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,000
for a very long time

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,039
it is disco elysium

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,539
if you are discovering the channel

8
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,739
based on this which is likely

9
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,339
my name is brady

10
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:20,539
I'm a therapist

11
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,820
we are going to be doing a long form analysis

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,219
of the game that we're going to play

13
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,640
we'll probably play out the games

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,500
in the future as well

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,339
and we tend to ask questions

16
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:31,760
like okay so

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,500
let's imagine this character was my client

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,200
what sort of things do I think

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,539
that they would be dealing with

20
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,439
what sort of approach would I use

21
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,259
to help them

22
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,020
that's kind of what we're getting into

23
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,979
and I also myself am interested

24
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,140
in creative writing

25
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,859
I'm an aspiring writer

26
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:47,659
I have imposter syndrome

27
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:50,500
I don't know if I'd call myself an author

28
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
I did write a science fiction novel

29
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,740
a couple years ago

30
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,460
it's finished I didn't publish it

31
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,259
I don't know if I will

32
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:00,500
it's so old

33
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,460
it would need a full rewrite

34
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,799
I still keep telling myself to rewrite it

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,319
or write something new

36
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,640
that kind of parallels disco elysium

37
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,180
this is not your average game writing

38
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,200
there's a big focus on prose

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,980
from what I can tell

40
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,400
I don't know anything about the story

41
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,980
I don't know anything about the setting

42
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,000
it has a lot of acclaim

43
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,120
for its creative aspects

44
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,659
for its prosaic dialogue and narration

45
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,079
and that it's a crpg

46
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,500
I like crpgs

47
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,260
I'm a fan of baldur's gate

48
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,859
and divinity series

49
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,719
I played original sin a couple years ago

50
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,120
fantastic game

51
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,030
I'm currently playing through baldur's gate 3

52
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,159
I really enjoyed pillars of eternity

53
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,659
so those kinds of games I'm really into

54
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,840
and we have tried to play games on stream

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,540
but discussing things from a therapeutic perspective

56
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,379
they can go quite long

57
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,819
so I'm going to keep my thoughts focused

58
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:49,560
and concise

59
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,920
but yeah I hope you enjoy what you see

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,299
we're going to be uploading this periodically

61
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,959
and if you want to check out the stream

62
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,719
see it live

63
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,319
we're welcome to do so as well

64
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,500
so yeah let's do it

65
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,379
let's get into it

66
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,439
let's go I'm ready

67
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,139
oh there it is

68
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,120
got my little brady box

69
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,639
hey brady I haven't seen you live

70
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,699
in quite a while

71
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:19,919
looking forward to you playing
