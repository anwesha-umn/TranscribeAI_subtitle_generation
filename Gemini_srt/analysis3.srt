1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,339
okay let's talk about bad decisions

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,940
so if you're like me you've been there

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,359
it's the end of the day or the morning

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,939
you plan a solid day for yourself

5
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:13,960
you'll be disciplined

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,199
you'll come home from work

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:15,480
you'll run errands

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,320
you'll treat yourself well

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,320
you'll make a healthy meal

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,480
you'll go to the gym

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,839
you'll exercise

12
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,100
then you'll read a book

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,760
you'll advance your life

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
this is your volition

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,820
it leads to good decisions

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,239
but this doesn't always work

17
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,600
sometimes you're undisciplined

18
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,179
errands are incomplete

19
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:31,539
you skip the gym

20
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,579
you order unhealthy takeout

21
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,340
you watch a show instead

22
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,439
you haven't advanced your life

23
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,960
what is happening

24
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,679
why ignore your volition

25
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,939
it could be many things

26
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,460
a mental health diagnosis amplifies it

27
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,119
this happens often

28
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,619
it happens to me

29
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,759
I'll share a framework

30
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,619
it explains why this happens

31
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:50,299
it shows what to do

32
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,700
this problem arises in my work

33
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,859
I've seen it clearly demonstrated

34
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,719
it has a unique role in games

35
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,780
there's a reason we don't follow volition

36
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,060
it's psychological friction

37
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,799
friction opposes behavioral change

38
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,299
regular friction is like this

39
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,740
on ice there's little friction

40
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,159
on concrete there's more friction
