00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,740
hello and welcome back to my therapist

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,759
plays disco elicium analysis series

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,000
in today's episode we are going to be taking

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,849
a very thorough look at how disco elicium portrays

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:14,839
intrusive thinking when electrochemistry starts

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,760
giving us thoughts and they are very much opposed

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,579
to the thoughts of volition

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,719
and how this actually very accurately represents

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,420
some of our very real thinking patterns

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,300
so we are going to be using actual theory

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,239
to break this down using the cognitive model

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,859
how actual cognitive behavioral therapy works

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,640
and how we might apply it to a situation

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,520
that our detective finds himself in

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,799
with his own intrusive thinking

16
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,299
this one is going to be quite in depth

17
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,579
so I am excited to get into it and start it

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,920
alright so what we need to do now is figure out

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,579
where to go

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
this door he wants me to bust down

21
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,019
oh there is an end of day deep brief

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,879
kim can answer any lingering questions

23
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,280
you may have about the case in the rcm

24
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,019
join him in the whirling and rags balcony after 10

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,859
so what time is it

26
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,040
it is almost 10 so we have a little bit of time

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,760
before we can do that

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,480
do we have enough money to pay back mr guards

29
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,180
do we have enough

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,920
do we have

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,319
oh he has a ton of trash

32
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,120
let's go turn in the trash

33
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,459
let's pay a visit to the best character

34
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,859
in this entire game

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,759
ritter girl

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,740
let's see what she is up to

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,060
and let's get some money

38
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,860
yeah we are not accepting that bribe

39
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,460
fuck that guy

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,939
I don't care

41
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,580
we will solve our many problems

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,479
through rigorous environmentalism

43
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,719
I believe I am supposed to talk to this gentleman first

44
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,080
though

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,539
let's see what he has got to say

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,979
what is nice and not
