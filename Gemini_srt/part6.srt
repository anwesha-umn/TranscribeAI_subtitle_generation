00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,440
hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,860
elicium analysis series

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,259
so on today's episode we're getting deeper

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,960
into our different character studies

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,099
we're breaking down the psychological dynamics

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,219
in their dialogue and their relationships

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,579
this represents mental health

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,039
I focus on two characters

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,879
that we meet on our journey

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,079
through revisho

11
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,339
I give my deepest psychoanalytical impressions

12
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,260
maybe my most unhinged character analysis

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,019
it discusses important things

14
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,160
about how the game depicts its world building

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,659
what characters do we need to look at

16
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:40,979
if we look at the shape of their mental health

17
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,439
this will tell us a lot

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,100
about living in this environment

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,979
with these political systems and social tensions

20
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:51,140
what is the result on the people

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,560
there's a lot to get into

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm excited to share

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,060

24
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,560
okay let's continue

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,380
we were investigating our relationship with kim

26
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,259
I guess there's a section I missed

27
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:00,630
ah cool

28
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,299

29
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,680

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,739

31
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:07,859
I find it very interesting

32
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,379
this was the primary skill I chose

33
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:12,400
in the last stream I disagreed with its intrusions

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,659
it's cool for dreamers paranatural investigators

35
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,920
and mental creators

36
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,859
I am an investigator and a mental creator

37
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:24,500
I make stuff in my brain

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,239
it's better than reality

39
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,120
empathy is cool for judges

40
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,359
interviewers and interrogators

41
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,519

00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,159

experts of psychological warfare and respect junkies

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,500
this is cool for cops

47
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,659
cop - efficient autos and pretend cops

48
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,560
that last one is us the pretend cop
