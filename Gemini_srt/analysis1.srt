00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,500
okay hello and welcome

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,080
it's a special interlude episode

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,000
I wanted to put it out before the next stream

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,300
so this I may do from time to time

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,500
taking a chunk of the analysis

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,580
putting it in its own video

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,440
sometimes it takes a while

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,739
to collect my thoughts on things

9
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,059
it doesn't always happen live

10
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,079
but also I foresee this playthrough

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,620
being quite long at our usual pace

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,839
it can be hard to get into a let's play

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,760
especially at episode 30 or something

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,120
it's hard to hop in that far down

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,480
so I thought it'd be cool

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,920
to do little chunks of character studies

17
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,479
analysis of the game's systems

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,299
how they represent mental health

19
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:38,359
as separate videos

20
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,700
basically for people who can't commit

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,359
the time to watch all the let's play videos

22
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,840
they can still enjoy this breakdown

23
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
so that's what we're doing today

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,439
I have to talk about something

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,560
I couldn't wait until the next stream

26
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,259
so that's what we're doing now

27
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,320
disco elysium portrays a specific aspect

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,079
of mental health I've never seen portrayed this way

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,240
one of the biggest challenges is explaining

30
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,340
how you can want something

31
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,799
you could desperately want to not be depressed

32
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,379
you can desperately want to be sober

33
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:08,000
our behaviors don't agree with that desire

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,879
how do you explain that to someone

35
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,239
they want to stop using but can't

36
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,459
this is a mentality our lead detective had

37
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:14,739
before he lost his memory

38
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:15,840
he's still struggling with it

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,239
as he finds cigarettes

40
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,340
it comes down to this

41
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,760
we have a limited way of talking about motivation

42
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,000
why you do things why you want things

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,700
disco elysium comes into the picture

44
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,420
with different aspects of the main character's psyche

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,739
they have different motivations

46
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,719
they influence you to follow different paths

47
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,799
one motivation will tell you to smack that kid
