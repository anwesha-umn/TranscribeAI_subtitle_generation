1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,960
okay hello and welcome back

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,740
to our therapist plays disco elicium

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,799
let's play series

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,119
if you are new here hello

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,439
welcome my name is brady

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,019
I'm a therapist

7
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:13,220
we are doing a long - form psychoanalysis

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,800
of the main character and his companions

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,039
and all the people we meet

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,339
on our journey through revigel

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,219
so in today's episode we're going to talk

12
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,320
about our main character's reflections

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,719
on his own self - identity

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,679
as we start to unpack things

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,640
that he is remembering about his past

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,280
psychologically what does it mean

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,340
to integrate a past version of yourself

18
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,700
who you may not have positive feelings about

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,560
into the identity you're building today

20
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,640
also we're going to see

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,759
if we could take another shot

22
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,359
with guna

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,719
so let's dive in

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,600
now one thing is a hanging thread

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,840
I want to return to my bedroom

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,719
while I'm here

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,560
we're playing the game like reading

28
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,619
some psychological class material

29
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:59,060
yeah if you're new to the euro brady experience

30
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,520
this is one part entertainment

31
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,759
one part master's level psychology lecture

32
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,900
one part my own self - therapy

33
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,780
read the problem part

34
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,060
let's do that

35
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,379
let's rewind

36
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:13,739
let's trace your drunken steps back home

37
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,859
jump across the raised channel bridge

38
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,420
southwest of here

39
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,680
fall over get up

40
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,840
get off the asphalt in 20 minutes

41
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,599
shuffle your feet through courtyards

42
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,739
scaring little children

43
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,540
that checks out

44
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,219
go under the great raised motor tract

45
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,700
the 881 until you reach the domain

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,079
eminol in north jamrock

47
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,209
the streets are frozen this time of year

48
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:43,340
caked with ice

49
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,859
walk down main to tradition

50
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:47,579
there's a side alley there

51
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,599
in your footprints in the mud

52
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,299
okay there's something there

53
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,739
there is a past for me

54
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,900
okay what is this

55
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,819
kim also tries not to look

56
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,700
at the pile of viscera on the carpet

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,480
or the weird suitcase on the hat rack

58
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:21,939
or the pot plant dying in the corner

59
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,979
but it's all too morbid to ignore

60
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:24,939
oh that's true

61
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:27,219
this is the first time

62
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,819
I've brought kim into the environment

63
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,560
maybe in a subconscious way

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,699
I'm trying to understand

65
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:35,620
how much can I destroy my own image

66
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,280
to him before I come to the conclusion

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,139
that he's not going to abandon me

68
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,400
maybe if I show him something intimate
