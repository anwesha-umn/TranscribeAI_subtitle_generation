I need to ask I need to solve this murder like I gotta be honest like the the murder is like the lowest priority thing to my character right now I genuinely believe that if I'm this character the murder is just a vehicle to discover more about who I was and in that process reckoning with the idea that I may have done something to myself to try to forget that person and here I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure that out I could go do oh I can go do the autopsy I have the gloves and I have the form maybe I should do that I'm just collecting tasks jam mystery I kind of want to go see the body let's do the notch - ops zero quick I have all the ingredients I need see what happens if you don't tell us something provide us information the rotting man lies on his side with his eyes looking straight through you the belt is still around his neck his body is supine and open to intrusion by autopsy . let's do that turn it\""
