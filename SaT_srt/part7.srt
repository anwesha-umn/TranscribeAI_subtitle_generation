00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,349
hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

2
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,910
so on today's episode we are delving even deeper into the psychology of our main character

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:29,449
is this case gets more complicated so does our relationship with ourselves because we're also going to start discovering more about who we were and finding that we are not so happy with that person before we had our amnesia and woke up as the person we are today

4
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,119
and so what does it mean to be faced with some of those challenges

5
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:40,210
do we avoid them and try to shut them out or do we look for healthy ways to integrate them and move forward

6
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,109
but we also do get into major confrontation

7
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:55,090
we're going to face what it is like when we go up against an individual named measurehead who stands between us and our next objective in solving the case

8
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,329
so all that is coming up in today's episode

9
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:06,140
and perhaps our first moments of genuine trust is starting to build between ourselves and our partner kip

10
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,890
I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you

11
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,650
so let's jump in

12
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:15,829
hey there's a big gentleman

13
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:25,810
we have right to

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,079
maybe this is the gentleman who was asking about our case

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,030
he's a large lad

16
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,739
what's going on here

17
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,250
hold up and stay front

18
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,510
the broad shoulder to alpha male turns to you

19
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,569
he's a full head taller than everybody else here

20
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:49,890
you here to fuck with us

21
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,890
beat the honest worker down

22
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,030
why should I

23
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,069
I hear the fight for a cause

24
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,530
stripes usually have problems with people who have causes

25
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,780
okay then I think I think no

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,219
I want to be on your team friend

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,520
good

28
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,680
we're fighting for a cause here

29
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,960
right to work

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
right to work

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,060
besides we're not that different

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
it helps if people see us talking cops and strikebreakers together

33
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,319
shows with our days around our side

34
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,229
builds confidence

35
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,389
I like his perspective

36
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:32,990
I agree

37
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,030
I agree with that

38
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:45,009
I think it's also kind of a power play that I'm like grinding the flashlight and everybody's face because it makes them feel like I'm really targeting them which is good for my interrogation

39
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,150
what kind of cause are we talking about

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:55,430
rights of workers to have gainful employment to make a salary and feed their families

41
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,969
well I don't want to politically align with him but I want to be on his team
