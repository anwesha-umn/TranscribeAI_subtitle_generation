00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,139
okay hello and also welcome

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,240
it's great to be back on stream and continuing our disco elicium playthrough

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,440
if you're just joining us which is a good chance that you are this is kind of still at the beginning of our little playthrough here

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,059
and what we're doing is we're kind of playing through it like mix of roleplay mix of psychoanalysis

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm brady

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm a therapist

7
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:35,149
and I'm going to be doing like different kinds of psychoanalysis on the characters and kind of linking that to the game design and like how it represents mental health

8
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:39,469
this game is just in another leak when it comes to that sort of thing so far

9
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:50,939
like I already did a video kind of talking about the skill system and how it represents this like very fascinating way to perceive like motivation and psychological priority

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,920
so yeah we're like we're going to get pretty deep with this

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,899
the last two playthroughs or last two streams

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:27,140
I'm sort of just been figuring out the game and now that I've like had some time to collect some thoughts on it I'll be talking a little bit more about the characters and their dynamics and like I guess why my character specifically is showing a lot of avoidance and confrontation and like is not maybe making some of the best decisions

13
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,879
I'm doing like a mix of my own head can in roleplay

14
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,260
like I'm not trying to play the game the best way

15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,219
honestly I'm just trying to make this a fun fun playthrough like just kind of doing wild shit

16
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,480
we're not going to see every single part of the game or every dialogue tree and that's okay you know

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:59,340
but it has been great to get some recommendations for things that like I just straight out missed because of like so far my character has just fallen into like he's just failing upwards basically

18
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:17,300
like passing some of the early skill checks some of the comments on the last video were telling me that like missing or succeeding in some of these early skill checks has like made me skip over a lot of tutorials which makes sense because I kind of feel lost on some of the systems

19
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,740
but that's okay

20
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:26,580
we're discovering it as we go and I think that just makes for interesting playthrough dynamics

21
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,939
what I have been fascinated by is how well the game has responded to my like weird way of approaching this

22
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,129
like it's completely fine that I skipped certain things

23
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,280
it's completely fine that I don't know how to play it very well

24
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,620
it's not like I've not reached a roadblock where the game is like hey slow down friend

25
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:57,699
I need to teach you this before you move on and it's happy to just let me move on and try to fail my way through everything which is kind of life isn't it

26
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,919
so with that said
