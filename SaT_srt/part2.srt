00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,679
okay hello and welcome back to our playthrough of disco elisium

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,740
we just finished the first little chunk of the game kind of starting our character

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:28,719
and yeah just figuring out who he is in this wild disgusting world and how wild and disgusting are we going to be to kind of meet the world where it's at

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:38,799
so I've sort of decided that the the character profile we're going with is like x or failed therapist turned dirty cop

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:50,570
kind of the idea like I tried to be a therapist but I found it was too easy to manipulate people or the more I learned about people the more

6
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,049
I could not help the urge to exploit that stuff

7
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:04,329
so I became a cop instead where I can hide behind a moral or duty justification for getting information from people

8
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,650
and I can sort of code that as this is a good thing for me and them

9
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,849
I'm actually protecting them by figuring out their dark secrets

10
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:12,530
so that's kind of where we're at

11
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,829
let's continue

12
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:23,260
and keep working on the scrim here

13
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,379
literally just came back at the perfect time

14
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,439
hell yeah let's let's look and go

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,189
okay let's check out the crime scene a little bit more here

16
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,120
get some cash lying around

17
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,739
never going to let that go to waste

18
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,819
some more magnesium

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:50,200
I think if we're going to need to stock up on magnesium this winch mechanism has been oxidating for some years

20
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,189
the kid's ladder is climbable

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,799
okay not too much interesting going on around here

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,060
let's check out the body

23
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,759
with bulging white eyes the face around them does not look human

24
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,360
it's swollen and ready to burst

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,340
his lips are fish like and his tongue like a ball gag in his mouth

26
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:23,099
okay it's pretty gruesome

27
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,000
you seem to be holding your breath

28
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,189
a cargo belt twists his neck at an unnatural angle

29
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,210
the body below appears stiff

30
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,930
it's letting out an ungodly rot

31
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,729
the smell seeps in even through your clenched nostrils

32
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:50,460
legendary let's go of your nose without throwing up

33
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,430
that's 17 % and has not steered me wrong yet
