1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,370
okay let's talk about why we make bad decisions

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:17,670
so if you're like me then you've probably been in that situation where it's the end of the day or it's the morning and you're thinking like okay I'm gonna make a solid plan for myself

3
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,289
today I'm gonna be disciplined

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,019
I'm gonna come home from work and I'm gonna get all these errands done and I'm gonna treat myself really well

5
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:30,530
I'm gonna make a nice healthy proper meal

6
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,229
I'm gonna go to the gym afterwards

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,990
I'm gonna exercise and then maybe when I come home I'll like start reading a book or something

8
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:46,030
I'll do something a little different something that makes me feel like I'm gonna advance my life in a new positive direction

9
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:54,409
and this is our real life volition and it's there to lead you on your way to making good life decisions

10
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,270
but this doesn't always work out that way

11
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,789
sometimes you get to the end of the day and you realize that you haven't been very disciplined at all

12
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:09,230
a lot of those errands are still incomplete or like half - started

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:17,430
we didn't end up going to the gym and instead of making a proper meal we've ordered some definitely not healthy takeout food

14
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:29,250
and instead of reading that book maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen and we've not advanced our life in a positive meaningful direction in any way at all

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,989
what is happening here

16
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:38,829
why would we ignore the voice of volition that's telling us to do all of these beneficial positive things

17
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:47,489
well it could be a lot of things honestly and definitely having like a mental health diagnosis is going to amplify this problem a lot more

18
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,609
but even for the average person this happens like pretty often

19
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,069
I mean it certainly happens to me

20
00:01:53,069 --> 00:02:01,730
so what I wanted to share with you today is a framework for understanding why this problem happens and what we can actually do about it

21
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,010
this is a real problem that actually comes up in my work as a therapist kind of often

22
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:18,389
and I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated so clearly and given such a unique role within the structure of a game like disco elysium has

23
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:25,969
so okay there is a reason that we do not always follow the voice of volition and go through with our good intentions

24
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:30,409
and it has to do with something called psychological friction

25
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:38,629
so in this context friction is any force either internal or external which opposes a behavioral change

26
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,409
so what do we know about like regular friction right

27
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:50,590
if I am standing on an ice rink and I move my body weight around a little bit I'm gonna start sliding around on the ice

28
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,789
there's not a lot of friction between me and the surface that's under me
