00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,799
hello and welcome back to our therapist plays disco elicium

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,459
let's play

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:05,940
if you're new here

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,980
hello my name is brady

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:20,879
I'm a therapist and we're doing kind of like a long forum psycho analysis of our main character and all the people that we meet in our twisted weird journey through revishol in disco elicium

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:33,859
so on today's episode we're kind of getting deeper into the analysis and actually kind of targeting our companion kim who at least in my playthrough and the way I'm sort of roleplaying this character

7
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:47,960
we don't have like the most trusting relationship with yet and kind of getting into the psychology of like what does it mean to want to trust someone but not be sure if you can yet

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:01:02,539
and how does someone who has a lot of like prior trauma like our main character does actually evaluate whether or not someone who promises to be there on your side is actually trustworthy in what they say

9
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:11,879
so today I'm gonna give you kind of a mix of psychological theory behind this idea and also how I would actually address something like this in practice as a therapist

10
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,219
so that said let's continue

11
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,180
okay so what do I need to do

12
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,540
I need to ask

13
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,159
I need to solve this murder

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,579
I got to be honest like the the murder is like the lowest priority thing to my character right now

15
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,780
I genuinely believe that if I'm this character

16
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:54,730
the murder is just a vehicle to discover more about who I was and in that process reckoning with the idea that I may have done something to myself to try to forget that person and here I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure that out

17
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:00,959
I could go do

18
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,790
oh I can go

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,609
do the autopsy

20
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:06,030
I have the gloves and I have the form

21
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,560
maybe I should do that

22
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:23,729
I'm just collecting tasks jam mystery

23
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,050
I kind of want to go see the body

24
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,689
let's do the autopsy real quick

25
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,110
I have all the ingredients I need

26
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,289
let's see what happens

27
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,629
maybe it'll tell us something provide us information

28
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:50,889
the rotting man lies on his side with his eyes looking straight through you

29
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,849
the belt is still around his neck

30
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,849
his body is supine and open to intrusion by autopsy

31
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,930
it's a good turn of
