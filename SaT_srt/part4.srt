00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,720
okay hello

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,660
and welcome back to our therapist plays disco elysium

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,759
let's play series

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,880
if you are new here then hello welcome

5
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:10,560
my name is brady

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,300
I'm a therapist

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:22,199
and we are doing like kind of a long form psychoanalysis of the main character and his companions and all the people that we meet on our journey through revisual

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:35,780
so in today's episode we're going to talk a lot about like our main characters reflections on his own self identity as we sort of start to unpack and discover things that he is remembering about his past

9
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:48,200
and psychologically what does it mean to integrate a past version of yourself who you may not have a lot of positive feelings about into the identity that you're building today

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,210
and also we're going to see if we can take another shot this whole thing with guna

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,859
so let's dive in

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,479
now one thing that is kind of a hanging thread is I want to return to my bedroom while I'm here

13
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,219
we're playing the game like reading some psychological class material

14
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:21,950
yeah if you're new to the euro brady experience this is one part entertainment one part master's level psychology lecture one part my own self therapy life or your enjoyment

15
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,780
read the problem part let's do that

16
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:26,819
let's rewind

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:40,700
let's trace your drunken steps back home jump across the raised channel bridge southwest of here fall over get up get off the asphalt in 20 minutes shuffle your feet through court yards scaring little children that checks out

18
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:51,200
go under the great raised motor tract the 881 until you reach the domain a mineral in north jamrock

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,980
the streets are frozen this time of year caked with ice walked down main to perdition

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,659
there's a side alley there in your footprints in the mud

21
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,439
okay there's something there

22
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,980
there is a past for me

23
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,180
okay what is this

24
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:35,580
kim also tries not to look at the pile of take viscera on the carpet or the weird suitcase on the hat rack or the pocket plant dying in the corner but it's all just too morbid to ignore

25
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,560
oh that's true

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,699
this is the first time I've brought kim into the environment

27
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:55,430
maybe in a subconscious way I'm trying to understand again how much can I destroy my own image to him before I come to the conclusion that he's not going to abandon me

28
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:59,969
maybe if I show him something intimate and disgusting
