00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,429
hello and welcome to another episode in my therapist plays disco leesium analysis series

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:17,949
so this time I wanted to share something that I learned about a particular character in the game and also some things that I learned about myself in the course of uploading this series

3
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:35,649
so just for context if you're just coming into this now the way I'm kind of playing through the game is from like the perspective of being a therapist and trying to provide as much commentary as I can on different angles of mental health that are depicted in the game

4
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:43,409
there's a lot more going on than just that at disco leesium but I'm really just I'm not the person to comment on like complicated political stuff

5
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,030
and one of the most important dynamics in the game is the one that you have with your partner kim kitsuragi

6
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:59,149
and I recognize that like as the player we're going to be a lot more aware of kim's qualities than my character the detective will

7
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:13,129
and so in my role play of him I have sort of been exploring the subject of someone who is coming from a background of trauma which we still don't know a lot about raphael from where I'm at in the game

8
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:26,930
but a lot of his issues with the way he views authority and relationships and his struggles with substance abuse kind of indicate that there may be some of that background present

9
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:44,349
so I've been kind of approaching a lot of the dialogue with kim from this perspective that like we tend to have an initial first impression about someone that we may want to trust them but if we're someone who has a lot of trust issues we may sort of like test that relationship over time

10
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,250
we may kind of see where the real boundaries are

11
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:57,180
and from my character's perspective he's kind of been trying to see like does kim stick around with me because he needs me to complete this case

12
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:05,790
or are the qualities that we immediately picked up on that he is earnest and trustworthy and a very honest character at heart

13
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:13,229
are those things going to last when we make ourselves very difficult to be around basically

14
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,650
I'm definitely going to ask him

15
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,789
I really want to impress him and I want him to think that I'm cool and that I'm not a f * * * ing mess

16
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:39,169
I've been kind of trying to demonstrate that like some of the closest relationships you can have are ones that have really been put through that test and have outlasted that period of like if I push this person far enough are they still going to stick with me

17
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:44,080
assai the lieutenant where is his nose in his notebook

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,569
see there's another thing that I'm not sure about kim
