00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,059
hello and welcome to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,759
on today's episode we are meeting

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,880
what has become another one of my absolute favorite characters that we've met so far

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:23,500
so we're going to be talking a lot with a net and her mother today learning more about the economic reality of being a child who has to work out in the cold all day

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:33,520
and in that dialogue we're also going to be continuing to build our own character profile sort of continuing the analysis using the jahari window that we started in the last episode

6
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:43,259
there's a lot of emotions to dig into and discuss in today's episode including some that may come up when we finally face ourselves

7
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:44,799
so that's where we're at

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm excited to continue so let's jump back in

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,579
okay

10
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,729
what shall we do next

11
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,380
I guess we can go enter the door behind the greenhouse

12
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,670
let's go do that

13
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,019
it's in the yard basement door

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,799
is that back there

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,040
yeah it's more useful on counseling

16
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:32,689
what does this girl up to

17
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,239
it's been a while since we've checked in

18
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,519
she is way too positive

19
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:44,590
oh it's snowing

20
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,840
what is this crime

21
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:57,340
it's about murders or burglaries or things like that and the work of a policeman or a private detective who's trying to solve a crime and catch the criminals

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,480
I need to know what crime is

23
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,639
it's that bad point here

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,960
crime is what we were solving before this conversation began

25
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,289
why would anyone want to read a crime

26
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,319
they fight it to people I guess

27
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:26,199
they get to imagine dangerous things and it's kind of like a puzzle where you can guess who the criminal is or how the good guys are going to catch him

28
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,900
I'm a policeman myself by the way

29
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,560
I don't look much like a policeman

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,500
I know

31
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,250
well what does a cop look like then

32
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,430
didn't mean to offend sir

33
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:37,449
sorry sir

34
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,870
it's just that you don't look like dick mullin

35
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:42,479
she points to a book cover

36
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,789
I wish you can see strapping vespertine officer

37
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,789
he stems grinly over the body of a dead woman

38
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,060
you know nobody actually looks like the guy in the picture

39
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,620
it's not your body that's important in police work

40
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,740
it's your head
