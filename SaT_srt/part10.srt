00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,620
hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:20,960
on today's episode we're going to address something kind of unavoidable in a game like this which is what are some of the crossovers between politics and mental health and kind of some personal struggles I have about integrating those two subjects

3
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm sure there will be a lot of discussion about this in the comments

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,420
you know that this is all recorded previously

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:41,539
I think I'm going to probably make a dedicated video at some point kind of like compiling my thoughts a little more but yeah we get an early look at kind of where my mind is coming from on this

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,299
aside from that we have a very special moment in this episode which is finally we're going to reach the end of our first day as a detective

7
00:00:50,719 --> 00:01:02,859
it's taken us a while and we're going to take another look at how kiminai's relationship has been developing over this very challenging day and see if there's actually some things that we'd become quite close on

8
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,819
so all that's coming up

9
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,060
I'm excited to get into it

10
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,379
let's do it

11
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,079
alrighty we are going to talk to kim

12
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,430
we should think about calling it today maybe

13
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,370
the nights are still miserably cold this time of year

14
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,299
I haven't paid the cafeteria manager for the damages yet

15
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,359
I should take care of that then

16
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,719
I don't have the money

17
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,299
I don't have the money

18
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:26,659
I'm stuck to him anyway

19
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,659
an office of the rcm shouldn't be sleeping in the street

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,439
we'll figure something out

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,939
though he finds this situation frustrating he is doing his best to not make you feel any worse than you already do

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,819
I respect that kim

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,079
he's kim is what a lot of points with me these chapters of our stream

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,450
okay let's see if we can reason with this gentleman

25
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,939
can I help you

26
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,049
but I don't have another option here

27
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,859
yes have you got it

28
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,080
can we come to some sort of arrangement

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,400
is that arrangement include you paying me what we already agreed you owe me

30
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,030
kim is about to say something

31
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,789
let him

32
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,490
let's do that

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,740
I understand your predicament as the manager

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,810
however I feel I must remind you that we are here to conduct an important investigation that also affects your business

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,740
that's good point

36
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,780
put the squeeze on him

37
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:46,069
forgive me for saying this but your colleagues seems more committed to drinking and he stops me in sentence

38
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,789
he shrinks back a bit under the lieutenant severe gaze

39
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,210
I mean no effects

40
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,030
it's really nothing personal

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,650
I just have to protect the interests of this establishment

42
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,430
no kiddie
