hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:25,379
in today's episode we are going to be taking a very thorough look at how disco elicium portrays intrusive thinking when electrochemistry starts giving us thoughts and they are very much opposed to the thoughts of volition and how this actually very accurately represents some of our very real thinking patterns

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,759
so we are going to be using actual theory to break this down using the cognitive model how actual cognitive behavioral therapy works and how we might apply it to a situation that our detective finds himself in with his own intrusive thinking

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,619
this one is going to be quite in depth so I am excited to get into it instead of it

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,700
