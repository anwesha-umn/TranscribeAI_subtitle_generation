00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,820
hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elysium analysis series

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:20,079
so on today's episode we're getting deeper into our different character studies and kind of breaking down like the psychological dynamics in their dialogue and the relationships and everything that represents in terms of mental health

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:29,019
this time I give a lot of focus to two characters in particular that we meet on our journey through revisheil and one of them that I give kind of like my deepest

4
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:40,960
psychoanalytical impressions yet maybe also my most unhinged character analysis as far as well

5
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:52,460
but it is in service of actually kind of discussing like some important things about how the game depicts its world building and what characters do we need to look at

6
00:00:52,659 --> 00:01:05,560
in terms of like if we look at the shape of their mental health this will tell us a lot about what it is like to live in this environment with these political systems with these social tensions

7
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,260
like what is the result of that on the people who are actually being brought up in this world

8
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,859
so there's a lot to get into

9
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,799
I'm excited to share

10
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,340
so let's jump back in

11
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:17,780
okay

12
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,450
let's continue

13
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,409
so I think the last thing we were doing is kind of investigating our relationship with kim here

14
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,620
I guess if it's a section of this that I missed

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,659
cool for I see what you mean

16
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,120
I thought it was something I had to click on

17
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:50,189
so let's check out inland empire because that's our main skill and I'm finding it very interesting that this was the primary skill that I chose

18
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,430
especially because in the last stream I found myself kind of disagreeing with its intrusions a little more

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,099
it says it's cool for dreamers paronatural investigators and mental creators

20
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:17,169
I don't know if I'd call myself paronatural but I am an investigator and I am a mental creator meaning that I tend to make stuff in my brain that's better than I can make it in reality

21
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,080
empathy is cool for judges of character interviewers and interrogators

22
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:24,960
yeah that's me as well

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,819
this is a volition is cool for sane people well adjusted cops the non suicidal

24
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,560
it's kind of half of us right

25
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,849
empathy is cool for leaders experts of psychological warfare and respect junkies

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,580
okay

27
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,719
yes yes and yes

28
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,379
this one is cool for cops cop - efficient autos and pretend cops
