00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:12,580
okay hello and welcome to the beginning of a special playthrough of a game that I have been kind of like talking about with my community to play for a very long time

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,980
it is disco elisium

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,160
if you are just discovering the channel based on this which is a good likelihood that you are my name is brady I'm a therapist and we are going to be doing like kind of a long form

4
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:32,359
analysis of the game that we are going to play we will probably play other games in the future as well

5
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:42,210
and we tend to ask a lot of questions kind of in the space of like okay so let's imagine this character was my client

6
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,570
like what sort of things do I think that they would be dealing with

7
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,909
what sort of approach would I use to help them

8
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:55,329
right so that's kind of what we are going to be getting into and I also myself am interested in creative writing

9
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,689
I would say like I'm an aspiring writer

10
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:05,049
I have a bit of an imposter syndrome around like I don't know if I'd call myself an author or not

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,170
I did write a science fiction novel a couple years ago

12
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:07,890
it's finished

13
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,189
I didn't publish it and I don't know if I will at this point

14
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:23,209
it's just so old now that it would need like a full rewrite and you know I still keep telling myself to go back and rewrite it or write something new

15
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,329
and I know that that kind of parallels just go elysium as like this is not your average game writing

16
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,010
there's a big focus on pros from what I can tell

17
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,390
I don't know anything about the story

18
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,209
I actually don't even really know anything about the setting

19
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:51,349
the only things I really know about it is that it has a lot of a claim a lot of for its like creative aspects for its like prosaic dialogue and narration

20
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,650
and that it's kind of a crpg

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,129
I like crpgs

22
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,629
I'm a fan of baldur's gate and divinity series

23
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,430
I played original sin too a couple years ago

24
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,090
fantastic game

25
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,689
I'm currently playing through baldur's gate 3

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,569
really enjoyed pillars of eternity as well

27
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:20,090
so those kinds of games I'm really into and we have tried to play games on stream before but just by the nature of like

28
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,550
you know discussing things from a therapeutic perspective

29
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:25,789
they can go quite long

30
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,650
so I'm going to be trying to keep my thoughts a little more focused and concise

31
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,789
but yeah I hope you enjoy what you see here today

32
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,969
we're going to be uploading this kind of periodically

33
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,009
and if you want to come check out the stream

34
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:38,729
see it live

35
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,969
we're welcome to do so as well

36
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:41,349
so yeah

37
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,349
let's do it

38
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,210
let's get into it

39
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:44,370
let's go

40
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:44,729
I'm ready

41
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:46,770
oh there it is

42
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,210
got my little brady box in the corner there

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,979
hey brady haven't seen you live in quite a while looking forward to you playing this
