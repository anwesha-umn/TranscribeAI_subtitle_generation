hello and welcome to my therapist plays disco lissium analysis series

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:15,060
so on today's episode the plot sign we are going to see if we can establish our authority with tidus the union boss

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,239
we're going to see if we can get a little closer to a confession from him on who exactly was involved with the murder in march of mays

4
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:31,579
and over on the analysis side we're going to be taking a deep dive into the rigorous self - critique thought

5
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:38,759
now that we finally internalize this one it opens the door for a lot of discussion on harry's sense of self

6
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,960
and kind of digging into the question of is he actually a good person

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,200
and if he's not let's see think that it's possible to become one

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,780
this one's a little bit heavier on the analysis but it's pretty exciting to finally peel back more layers of our character

9
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,759
so let's jump in

10
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,579
any predictions on where the story will go or who's the killer

11
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:16,739
I kind of had the idea that we would be somewhat involved in the killing like because we are so uninitiated to our own past

12
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:28,090
I don't think that we did it like would have hung him up like that but I sort of have the suspicion that the dock workers are kind of like a red hairing

13
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,689
I just don't buy it

14
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,930
I just don't buy it

15
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,030
that's what we're leading but that could be wrong

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,890
I am notoriously bad at predicting the plot of anything ever

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:50,180
like when you have already probably noticed this but like when politics or the plot are part of the dialogue my brain like it does this

18
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,719
it feels like it condenses down to like I've had to do this before where I'm like okay what is happening here

19
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,099
my brain is just equipped for like character analysis

20
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:06,400
and the way I engage with media just privately is like when I'm watching something I'm not really thinking about the plot

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,699
I'm very rarely like well I'm not like watching shutter island and I'm like where is this going

22
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,819
I wonder what's going to happen next

23
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:20,620
my brain just like accepts whatever's going to happen but what I'm thinking about is like wow what is that character feeling right now

24
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,539
I wonder how like whatever is going to happen to them is going to change their worldview

25
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:29,580
like that's more where my mind is focused

26
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,939
and I kind of just accept the plot whatever it is

27
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,379
it doesn't matter that much to me

28
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,180
the sequence of things happening

29
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,139
unless it is so egregious that I'm like this doesn't make any sense

30
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,210
what if it was lena

31
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,050
well I refuse to accept that

32
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:54,460
lena is too kind hard and good - natured for her to be involved in that

33
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,000
it's funny therapists often seem to struggle with things like predicting stuff or telling if someone is lying
