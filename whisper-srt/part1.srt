00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,700
Okay, hello and welcome back to our playthrough of disco elisium

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:15,120
We just finished kind of like the first little chunk of the game kind of starting our character and

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,120
Yeah, just figuring out who he is in this wild disgusting world and how wild and disgusting are we going to be to

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,760
Kind of meet the world where it's at

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,500
So I've sort of decided that the the character profile we're going with is like

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,820
X or failed therapist turned dirty cop

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,660
Kind of the idea like

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,560
I tried to be a therapist, but I found it was too easy to manipulate people or

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,600
The more I learned about people the more I could not help the urge to

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:01,380
exploit that stuff so I became a cop instead where I can hide behind a moral or duty justification for

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,650
Getting information from people and I can sort of code that as this is a good thing for me and them

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,560
I'm actually protecting them by figuring out their dark secrets. So that's kind of where we're at

13
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,320
Let's continue and

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,400
and

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,300
Keep working on this crime here

16
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,440
Literally just came back at the perfect time hell yeah, let's let's let's look and go

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,240
Okay, let's check out the crime scene a little bit more here

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,840
Get some cash lying around never gonna let that go to waste some more magnesium

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,220
I think we're gonna need to stock up on magnesium

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,220
This one mechanism has been oxidating for some years

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,260
The kids ladder is climbable

22
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,100
Okay, not too much interesting going on around here. Let's check out the body

23
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,760
With bulging white eyes the face around them does not look human

24
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,360
It's swollen and ready to burst his lips are fish like and his tongue like a ball gag in his mouth

25
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,040
Okay, it's pretty pretty gruesome you seem to be holding your breath

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:35,240
They cargo belt twist his neck at an unnatural angle the body below appears stiff

27
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,800
It's letting out an ungodly rot the smell seeps in even through your clenched nostrils

28
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,500
Legendary let's go of your nose without throwing up

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,260
That's 17%

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Has not steered me wrong yet. Oh, it looks like my camera is frozen
