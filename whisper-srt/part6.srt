Hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series. So on

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,210
today's episode we're getting deeper into our different character studies and

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,460
kind of breaking down like the psychological dynamics in their dialogue and

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,060
their relationships and everything that represents in terms of mental health.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,260
This time I give a lot of focus to two characters in particular that we meet on

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,640
our journey through Revisho and one of them that I give kind of like my

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:39,020
deepest psychoanalytical impressions yet maybe also my most unhinged character

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,760
analysis as far as well but it is in service of actually kind of discussing

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,820
like some important things about how the game depicts its world building and

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,280
what characters do we need to look at and in terms of like if we look at the

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,630
shape of their mental health this will tell us a lot about what it is like to

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,120
live in this environment with these political systems with these social

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,380
tensions like what is the result of that on the people who are actually being

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,820
brought up in this world so there's a lot to get into I'm excited to share

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:24,500
so let's jump back in. Okay let's continue so I think the last thing we were

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,360
doing is kind of investigating our relationship with Kim here I guess

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,040
there's a section of this that I missed. Ah cool four I see what you mean I

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,840
thought it was something I had to click on so let's check out Inland Empire

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,620
because that's our main skill and I'm finding it very interesting that this

20
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:56,220
was the primary skill that I chose especially because in the last stream I

21
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,150
found myself kind of disagreeing with its intrusions a little more. It says

22
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,740
it's cool for dreamers, paranatural investigators and mental creators. I don't

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,700
know if I'd call myself paranatural but I am an investigator and I am a

24
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,440
mental creator meaning that I tend to make stuff in my brain that's better

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,280
than I can make it in reality. Empathy is cool for judges of character

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,350
interviewers and interrogators yeah that's me as well. This is a

27
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,120
volition is cool for sane people well-adjusted cops the non-suicidal it's

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,640
kind of half of us right. Authority is cool for leaders experts of psychological

29
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:52,200
warfare and respect junkies okay yes yes and yes this one is cool for cops

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,700
cop-efficient autos and pretend cops I feel like that last one is us the

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,340
pretend cop.
