Hello and welcome to my therapist plays disco lesium analysis series. So on

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,840
today's episode the plot sign we are going to see if we can establish our

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,710
authority with Tidus the Union boss. We're gonna see if we can get a little

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,380
closer to a confession from him on who exactly was involved with the murder in

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,490
Marche Nays. And over on the analysis side we're gonna be taking a deep dive

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,960
into the rigorous self critique thought. Now that we finally internalize this one

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,890
it opens the door for a lot of discussion on Harry's sense of self and kind of

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,340
digging into the question of is he actually a good person? And if he's not

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,480
does he think that it's possible to become one? This one's a little bit

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,860
heavier on the analysis but it's pretty exciting to finally peel back more

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,160
layers of our character. Let's jump in. Any predictions on where the story will

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,540
go or who's the killer? I kind of had the idea that we would be somewhat

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,500
involved in the killing like because we are so uninitiated to our own past.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,820
I don't think that we did it like would have hung him up like that but I sort of

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,100
have the suspicion that the dock workers are kind of like a red hairing. I just

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,980
don't buy it. I just don't buy it that's that's what we're leading but I could be

17
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,860
wrong. I am notoriously bad at predicting the plot of anything ever like when

18
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,840
you have already probably noticed this but like when politics or the plot are

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,200
part of the dialogue my brain like it does this it feels like it condenses

20
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,940
down to like I've had to do this before where I'm like okay what is happening

21
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,280
here? My brain is just equipped for like character and analysis and the way I

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,290
engage with media just privately is like when I'm watching something I'm not

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,710
really thinking about the plot. I'm very rarely like well I'm not like

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,920
watching shutter island and I'm like where's this going? I wonder what's

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,820
gonna happen next? My brain just like accepts whatever's going to happen but

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,680
what I'm thinking about is like wow what is that character feeling right now?

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,830
You know I wonder how like whatever is going to happen to them is going to

28
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,180
change their worldview like it's that's that's more where my mind is focused

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,890
and I kind of just accept the plot whatever it is it doesn't matter that much to

30
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,840
me the sequence of things happening unless it is so egregious that I'm like this

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,260
doesn't make any sense what if it was Lena well I refuse to accept that

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,630
Lena is too kindhearted and good-natured for her to be involved in that it's

33
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,220
funny therapists often seem to struggle with things like predicting stuff

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,340
or telling if someone is lying well that's true because like
