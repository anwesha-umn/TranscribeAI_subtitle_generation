Hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series. So on

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,480
today's episode we are delving even deeper into the psychology of our main

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,940
character. Is this case gets more complicated so does our relationship with

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,220
ourselves because we're also going to start discovering more about who we were

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,080
and finding that we are not so happy with that person before we had our

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,970
amnesia and woke up as the person we are today and so what does it mean to be

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,300
faced with some of those challenges do we avoid them and try to shut them out

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,320
or do we look for healthy ways to integrate them and move forward but we also

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,760
do get into major confrontation we're going to face what it is like when we go

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,400
up against an individual named measurehead who stands between us and our next

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,180
objective in solving the case so all that is coming up in today's episode and

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,940
perhaps our first moments of genuine trust starting to build between ourselves

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,260
and our partner Kip. I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you so

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,860
let's jump in. Hey there's a big gentleman.

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:36,760
Scared. Maybe this is the gentleman who was asking about our case is a large

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:46,760
lead what's going on here. The broad shoulder alpha male turns to you he's a

17
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,810
full head taller than everybody else here. You hear to fuck with us beat the

18
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:59,240
honest worker down. Why should I hear the fight for a cause? Stripes usually have

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:08,610
problems with people who have causes. Okay then I think I think no I want to be on

20
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,160
your team friend.

21
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:18,640
Good. We're fighting for a cause here. Right to work. Right to work. Besides we're not that

22
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,480
different. It helps if people see us talking cops and strikebreakers together.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,700
Shows with our days are on our side. Builds confidence. I like his perspective I

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,040
agree. I agree with that. I think it's also kind of a power play that I'm like

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,180
grinding the flashlight and everybody's face because it makes them feel like I'm

26
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,700
really targeting them which is good for my interrogation. What kind of trials are

27
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,440
we talking about? Well I don't want to politically align with him but I want to

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,000
be on his team.
