Hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elisium analysis series.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,600
Okay, I'm really excited about today's episode.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,680
We're finally getting into our first encounter with the union boss Everart Claire

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,920
and kind of breaking down lots of different psychological angles on power dynamics

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,380
and have a lot to share today on real techniques that I actually use in my practice as a therapist

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,290
to navigate sort of like difficult conversations with people who either don't want to talk to you

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:40,680
or are in some sort of power struggle and how do you sort of get that person opening up about

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,520
things. We're going to use some of those techniques on Mr. Claire and by the end of this episode

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,720
we're going to learn a little bit more about ourselves and what kind of comp we are.

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,620
Yes, we're finally getting our copo type. I'm sure very few of you will be surprised at

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,180
what I end up with. So I'm excited to share this one. Let's dive in.

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, so I have an objective. I have the objective to progress this game's storyline. Like

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:21,420
I do want to just like mention why I am going about playing this game this way because I do

14
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,410
think it's relevant when you see my character do things like just totally give up on

15
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,540
pursuing the narrative to try to find like cigarettes for example.

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,900
This is a roleplay, right? So sometimes I'm going to be speaking as like Brady the therapist.

17
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,290
Sometimes I'm going to be speaking as like Brady the degenerate who is using this as a kind of

18
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:52,500
escapism from my very serious real life that I like this is where I get to give me a goofball.

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,910
And sometimes I'm going to like speak from the voice of my character, right? And just like say

20
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:06,160
random nonsense garbage that I think he would say or think, right? And one of the things that

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:15,980
is really important about this character specifically because he is someone representing the struggle

22
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,820
of addiction is how like we have all kinds of priority structures in our mind, right? Like

23
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,480
there's the whole just basic needs hierarchy of like you need food, you need water, you need rest.

24
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,560
And only once those things are satisfied can you really focus on like higher order things like,

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,800
you know, your self-esteem and your self-worth and the balance of health and your relationships

26
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,830
and those sorts of things, right? The problem with addiction is that your body has become dependent

27
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:58,380
on a chemical one that's harmful to you and so it completely hijacks what should be a normal

28
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,940
set of priorities.
