Hello and welcome back to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,850
In today's episode we are going to be taking a very thorough look at how disco elicium portrays

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:19,580
intrusive thinking when electrochemistry starts giving us thoughts and they are very much opposed to the thoughts of volition

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,420
and how this actually very accurately represents some of our very real thinking patterns.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,860
So we are going to be using actual theory to break this down using the cognitive model, how actual cognitive behavioral therapy works

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,800
and how we might apply it to a situation that our detective finds himself in with his own intrusive thinking.

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,580
This one is going to be quite in depth so I am excited to get into it and start it.

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:54,580
Alright so what we need to do now is figure out where to go.

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
This door he wants me to bust down.

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,020
Oh there is an end of day deep brief.

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,280
Kim can answer any lingering questions you may have about the case in the RCM.

12
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,020
Join him in the whirling and rags balcony after 10.

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,860
So what time is it?

14
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,760
It is almost 10 so we have a little bit of time before we can do that.

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,480
Do we have enough money to pay back Mr. Guards?

16
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,320
Do we have enough? Do we have? Oh he has a ton of trash.

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,860
Let's go turn in the trash. Let's pay a visit to the best character in this entire game.

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,060
Ritter girl. Let's see what she is up to and let's get some money.

19
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,460
Yeah we are not accepting that bribe. Fuck that guy.

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,480
I don't care. We will solve our many problems through rigorous environmentalism.

21
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,080
I believe I am supposed to talk to this gentleman first though.

22
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,540
Let's see what he has got to say.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,980
What is nice and not.
