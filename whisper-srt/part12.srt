Hello and welcome to my therapist plays disco elicium analysis series. On today's

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,440
episode we are meeting what has become another one of my absolute favorite

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,480
characters that we've met so far. So we're gonna be talking a lot with a net and

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,760
her mother today learning more about the economic reality of being a child who

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,240
has to work out in the cold all day. And in that dialogue we're also gonna be

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,120
continuing to build our own character profile sort of continuing the analysis

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,560
using the jahari window that we started in the last episode. There's a lot of

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,120
emotions to dig into and discuss in today's episode including some that may

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,580
come up when we finally face ourselves. So that's where we're at. I'm excited to

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:58,590
continue so let's jump back in. Okay. What shall we do next? I guess we can go

11
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,800
enter the green the door behind the green house. Let's go do that. It's in the yard

12
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,100
basement door. Is that back there? Yeah it's more useful on counseling.

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:38,180
What is this girl up to? It's been a while since we've checked in. She is way too

14
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:51,310
positive. Oh it's snowing. What is this crime? It's about murders or burglaries

15
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,620
or things like that and the work of a policeman or a private detective who's

16
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:07,520
trying to solve a crime and catch the criminals. I need to know what crime is. It's

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,000
that bad. Pointy red. Crime is what we were solving before this conversation began.

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,190
Why would anyone want to read a crime? They get to imagine dangerous things and

19
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,870
it's kind of like a puzzle where you can guess who the criminal is or how the

20
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,170
good guys are going to catch him. I'm a policeman myself by the way. I don't

21
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,280
look much like a policeman. I know. Well what does a cop look like that?

22
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,690
She points to a book cover on which you can see strapping

23
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,200
Vesparteen officer. He stems grinly over the body of a dead woman. You know

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,510
nobody actually looks like the guy in the picture. It's not your body that's

25
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,840
important in police work. It's your head.
