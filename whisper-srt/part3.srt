00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:09,090
Okay. Hello. And also welcome. It's great to be back on stream and continuing our disco

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,710
elicium playthrough. If you're just joining us, which is a good chance that you are, this

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,930
is kind of still at the beginning of our little playthrough here. And what we're doing

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,460
is we're kind of playing through it like mix of roleplay, mix of psychoanalysis. I'm

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,540
Brady, I'm a therapist. And I'm going to be doing like different kinds of psychoanalysis

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,660
on the characters and kind of linking that to the game design and like how it represents

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,310
mental health. This game is just in another league when it comes to that sort of thing so

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,620
far. Like I already did a video kind of talking about the skill system and how it represents

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,040
this like very fascinating way to perceive like motivation and psychological priority.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,820
So yeah, we're like, we're going to get pretty deep with this. The last two playthroughs

11
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:05,530
or last two streams. I'm sort of just been figuring out the game. And now that I've

12
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,500
like had some time to collect some thoughts on it, I'll be talking a little bit more about

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,460
the characters and their dynamics. And like I guess why my character specifically is

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,560
showing a lot of avoidance and confrontation and like is not maybe making some of the

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,260
best decisions. I'm doing like a mix of my own head can in roleplay. Like I'm not trying

16
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,650
to play the game the best way. Honestly, I'm just trying to make this a fun play through

17
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,680
like just kind of doing wild shit. We're not going to see every single part of the game

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,520
or every dialogue tree. And that's okay. But it has been great to get some recommendations

19
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,540
for things that like I just straight out missed because of like so far my character has

20
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,840
just fallen into like he's just failing upwards basically like passing some of the early

21
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,460
skill checks. Some of the comments on the last video were telling me that like missing

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,980
or succeeding in some of these early skill checks has like made me skip over a lot of tutorials

23
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,760
which makes sense because I kind of feel lost on some of the systems. But that's okay.

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,100
We're discovering it as we go. And I think that just makes for interesting playthrough

25
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,180
dynamics. What I have been fascinated by is how well the game has responded to my like

26
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,440
weird way of approaching this like it's completely fine that I skipped certain things.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,360
It's completely fine that I don't know how to play it very well. It's not like I've

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,950
not reached a roadblock where the game is like hey slow down friend. I need to teach you

29
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,120
this before you move on. It's happy to just let me move on and try to fail my way through

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,000
everything which is kind of life isn't it. So with that said...
