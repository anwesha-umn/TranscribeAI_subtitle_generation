00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,440
Hello, and welcome to another episode in my therapist plays Disco Elysium analysis series.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,640
So this time I wanted to share something that I learned about particular character in the game

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,980
and also some things that I learned about myself in the course of uploading this series.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,600
So just for context, if you're just coming into this now.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,960
The way I'm kind of playing through the game is from like the perspective of being a therapist

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,640
and trying to provide as much commentary as I can on different angles of mental health that are depicted in the game.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a lot more going on than just that at Disco Elysium, but I'm really just...

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,420
I'm not the person to comment on complicated political stuff.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,060
And one of the most important dynamics in the game is the one that you have with your partner, Kim Kitsuragi.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:59,180
And I recognize that like as the player, we're going to be a lot more aware of Kim's qualities than my character, the detective will.

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:07,820
And so in my roleplay of him, I've sort of been exploring the subject of someone who is coming from a background of trauma,

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,120
which we still don't know a lot about Rafael from where I'm at in the game.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:26,940
But a lot of his issues with the way he views authority and relationships and his struggles with substance abuse kind of indicate that there may be some of that background present.

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:37,000
So I've been kind of approaching a lot of the dialogue with Kim from this perspective that like we tend to have an initial first impression about someone that we may want to trust them.

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:44,320
But if we're someone who has a lot of trust issues, we may sort of like test that relationship over time.

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,240
We may kind of see where the real boundaries are.

17
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,740
And from my character's perspective, he's kind of been trying to see like...

18
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,240
Does Kim stick around with me because he needs me to complete this case?

19
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:05,800
Or are the qualities that we immediately picked up on that he is earnest and trustworthy and a very honest character at heart?

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,200
Are those things going to last when we make ourselves very difficult to be around basically?

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,140
I'm definitely going to ask him, I really want to impress him and I want him to think that I'm cool and that I'm not a f***ing miss.

22
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:31,680
I've been kind of trying to demonstrate that like some of the closest relationships you can have are ones that have really been put through that test and have outlasted that period of like...

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,780
If I push this person far enough, are they still going to stick with me?

24
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,060
A sigh. The lieutenant bears his nose in his notebook.

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,660
See, there's another thing that I'm not sure about Kim.

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,880
The way that she spoke to me just now, she's giving an honest reflection and she's empathizing with me,

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,000
whereas Kim is showing me disappointment and he's showing me mistrust like...
